[REDACTED_NAME] if [REDACTED_NAME] checks that at 10AM, then that report should have already updated, so it will show what they start with \ntoday\n\u00a0\n[REDACTED_NAME] is the same logic that [REDACTED_NAME] dashboard uses. E.g., at 12 AM, 1782530 was on the top of our dashboard:\n\u00a0\n[REDACTED_NAME]:\u00a0 \n[REDACTED_NAME] to some licensing constraints, TTU dashboard only records the data for last 24 hrs, and we can\u2019t backtrace further or adjust the time frame easily. \n[REDACTED_NAME]\u2019s known that above logic may underestimate TTU, since it only checks the last action, not the last customer incoming email.

[REDACTED_NAME] then, we have worked on upgrading our administration tools\u00a0 and we are now ready to proceed with this migration as per [REDACTED_NAME]\u2019s recommendations. \n\u00a0\n[REDACTED_NAME] want to remind you that: \nSafetyLink will connect to the ITU [REDACTED_NAME] [REDACTED_NAME] and [REDACTED_NAME] (MARS) website so radio licensing can be checked by all stakeholders in real time, helping to ensure the validity of the terminal\u2019s registration. \n[REDACTED_NAME] vessel owner will be invoiced by [REDACTED_NAME], as their [REDACTED_NAME] [REDACTED_NAME] [REDACTED_NAME] (PLESO). \nF\nor most of the countries, it will \nno longer be necessary to use a [REDACTED_NAME] of [REDACTED_NAME] (PSA) entity to activate or change any details of the activation. \n[REDACTED_NAME] moved to the SafetyLink portal, your [REDACTED_NAME]-C terminals will only\n \nbe able to connect to the [REDACTED_NAME] LESO stations, being [REDACTED_NAME] [REDACTED_NAME] in [REDACTED_NAME] (LES id21) or [REDACTED_NAME] (LES id04). [REDACTED_NAME] migration will protect [REDACTED_NAME]-C terminal owners from higher roaming costs. \n[REDACTED_NAME] that the working of the GMDSS distress signal is not impacted by this change. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n[REDACTED_NAME] if you do not agree with the migration:\n[REDACTED_NAME] you do not agree that your [REDACTED_NAME]-C terminals are migrated to SafetyLink, you shall notify [REDACTED_NAME] by \n[REDACTED_NAME] 20\nth\n of [REDACTED_NAME] 2025\n at the latest. [REDACTED_NAME] will not migrate your terminal from ESAS ([REDACTED_NAME] legacy system) and you will risk higher roaming costs. \n[REDACTED_NAME], if your terminal does not migrate to SafetyLink, an additional [REDACTED_NAME] charge shall then apply at \nten dollars ($10)\n per terminal per month from \n1\nst\n of [REDACTED_NAME] 2025\n.\n[REDACTED_NAME] letter shall serve as a price increase notification per [REDACTED_NAME] [REDACTED_NAME] and [REDACTED_NAME] in case you withhold your consent. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[REDACTED_NAME] to [REDACTED_NAME] team is committed to making the transition as seamless as possible.

[REDACTED_NAME] then, we have worked on upgrading our administration tools\u00a0 and we are now ready to proceed with this migration as per [REDACTED_NAME]\u2019s recommendations. \n\u00a0\n[REDACTED_NAME] want to remind you that: \nSafetyLink will connect to the ITU [REDACTED_NAME] [REDACTED_NAME] and [REDACTED_NAME] (MARS) website so radio licensing can be checked by all stakeholders in real time, helping to ensure the validity of the terminal\u2019s registration. \n[REDACTED_NAME] vessel owner will be invoiced by [REDACTED_NAME], as their [REDACTED_NAME] [REDACTED_NAME] [REDACTED_NAME] (PLESO). \nF\nor most of the countries, it will \nno longer be necessary to use a [REDACTED_NAME] of [REDACTED_NAME] (PSA) entity to activate or change any details of the activation. \n[REDACTED_NAME] moved to the SafetyLink portal, your [REDACTED_NAME]-C terminals will only\n \nbe able to connect to the [REDACTED_NAME] LESO stations, being [REDACTED_NAME] [REDACTED_NAME] in [REDACTED_NAME] (LES id21) or [REDACTED_NAME] (LES id04). [REDACTED_NAME] migration will protect [REDACTED_NAME]-C terminal owners from higher roaming costs. \n[REDACTED_NAME] that the working of the GMDSS distress signal is not impacted by this change. \u00a0\n\u00a0\n[REDACTED_NAME] if you do not agree with the migration:\n[REDACTED_NAME] you do not agree that your [REDACTED_NAME]-C terminals are migrated to SafetyLink, you shall notify [REDACTED_NAME] by \n[REDACTED_NAME] 20\nth\n of [REDACTED_NAME] 2025\n at the latest. [REDACTED_NAME] will not migrate your terminal from ESAS ([REDACTED_NAME] legacy system) and you will risk higher roaming costs. \n[REDACTED_NAME], if your terminal does not migrate to SafetyLink, an additional [REDACTED_NAME] charge shall then apply at \nten dollars ($10)\n per terminal per month from \n1\nst\n of [REDACTED_NAME] 2025\n.\n[REDACTED_NAME] letter shall serve as a price increase notification per [REDACTED_NAME] [REDACTED_NAME] and [REDACTED_NAME] in case you withhold your consent. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n[REDACTED_NAME] to [REDACTED_NAME] team is committed to making the transition as seamless as possible.
