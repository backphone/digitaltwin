Hi Antonios,
Â 
Thanks for the info.
Â 
To the question about wrong personnel, it should be due to the below resource setting in their Merits profile. The affected users need to update that.
Â 
Â 
Got a question about Python â€“ I tried that prevously, but human intervention seemed always required, due to 2FA., and I got below login window each time I run the script. Thus, I couldnâ€™t get the script to auto run periodically. 
Â 
How did you fix that? The server I connect to is we-prd-operations-kpis.database.windows.net.

 RE: Power BI Dashboard
Â 
Good day Guanglin, 
Â 
First of all, thank you very much for spending time on this for me. It is more that appreciated. 
Â 
I can understand that that what the report says, is more or less the content of this page per resource:
Assigned Vs Category
Â 
What is a bit strange is that for HRS and CG Service Desk, the report includes persons out of the team (for example
in HRS it shows a KAM in the list â€“ Prodromos Flitzanis) 
Â 
or persons that left the company quite some time ago (for example Aikaterini Bari)
Â 
From my side I wrote a python script (no surprise here 
ðŸ˜ƒ
) to mine some data from Merits from the URL: 
https://merits.marlink.com/tss/product/resource/report/default.cfm?page=4&resourceid=128
Â 
Once I am logged in, and press enter on cmd (as per above) I get a graph for the opened and closed cases for the past 10 days, something like this:
Quite helpful for me as it gives a good insight into the workload evolution and the nature of the cases (the script updates the graph every 1minute)
Â 
Now in regards to Graphana, no I havenâ€™t created those graphs. Those are actually available via this URL: 
https://mon.marlink.com/d/-UtCt6J4z/ticket-overview?orgId=1
 
and you can select your desired resource and period to be presented 
ðŸ˜‰
Â 
Â 
Thank you,

 Power BI Dashboard
Â 
Hi Antonios,
Â 
I have shared the below dashboard with you via a separate email, and you can take a look to see if this is what you need. It is scheduled to run at 8AM UTC daily.
Data are from database â€˜tss-subscriber-prdâ€™ Â at server â€˜we-prd-operations-kpis.database.windows.netâ€™. You can request for the access from IMSD, then you can use power BI to build such reports. 
Â 
The above dashboard is for monitoring the ongoing tickets. If you want to see how workload is distributed in a longer term, then we can check how many tickets each member closes too. Right now, I use the attached excel, but we should be able to make a dashboard rather easily.
Â 
A limitation I face is, that SQL database doesnâ€™t have historical statistics. E.g., I can check how many open tickets we have now, but not yesterday. Thus, itâ€™s difficult to show the changing trend. It seems you managed to solve that with Grafana. Did you build those dashboards by yourself? I tried that, but donâ€™t have the access. Do you know where the data source is or how I should talk to for such access?
Â 
Thanks.
