Hi Franck / Luc,
 
For your preparation, I’d like to understand the below during our meeting. Talk to you soon.
 
2 types of support involved:
- Deployment
- Post-deployment
 
Deployment:
- How many hours does it take to deploy 1 vessel?
- How do CCTS and network delivery interact on this?
 
Post-deployment:
- What are the common issues? How urgent are they?
- Possible to estimate how frequent a vessel encounters UTM issue? Or, how many UTM cases does CCTS get per week or month?
 
Training:
- Any documents, e.g., about deployment, activation and etc
- I presume session from Hans will be about deployment. If so, is it necessary to arrange separate ones for post-deployment cases?
- As informed by KAM, 4 deployments are planned in June, any chance for on-job training?
 
Operation:
- Any additional access that we shall get, on top of backoffice and URA? Our access to fortigate is read-only
- If it's beyond RCS capacity, will there be an 24x7 escalation point? I understand that CCTS on-duty phone is not for this purpose 
- Is it required to define a demarcation line?
