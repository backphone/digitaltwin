Hi
Can You inform your team that Bridgelink tickets should be sent to CCTS for troubleshooting if transfer to an higher team is needed.
Not directly to Telemar.

@VESTBY, Lars
,
Can you please inform your team to send unresolved Bridgelink ticket to CCTS following connectivity trouble shooting ?
CCTS is taking the responsibility to be between Maritime Ops and Telemar. 
 
Many thanks
