 RE: UTM Support 
 
Hi All,
 
Please find the meeting minutes below. Feel free to add in if anything is missed.
 
Understanding: 
No major UTM post-deployment incidents reported so far. CCTS only received change requests.  
Under normal circumstances, CCTS prepares VM and relevant XC/Fortigate configuration in advance, and hand them over to network delivery. 
RCS SG is not required for deployment activities. Process details will be covered during the training.
Once activated, RCS will follow the same checklist previously shared by Alexis, focusing on connectivity, XChange configuration, etc.
Escalation path: Connectivity issues -> MNOC,  XC/UTM cases-> CCTS. For urgent cases, contact CCTS 24x7 on-duty
 
Action items:
Training/Follow-up sessions:
By end of June:
 RCS SG to review the training done by Alexis / 
@SI, Guanglin
1st week of July:
  deployment training for Timothy. Selected RCS SG members will attend or review that for understanding./ 
@FERON, Luc
 
@VESTBY, Lars
 to coordinate with network team on the training date
2nd week of July:
  arrange a sync session among local network, RCS, KAM and SM in SG  / 
@SI, Guanglin
  
By end of July
: Frank to arrange for a go through of 10 CCTS tickets transferred to CCTS, to demonstrate troubleshooting procedures, and explain about the mechanism between UTM and Xchange. / 
@ARGANESE, Franck
 P.S. 
@SI, Guanglin
 will try to gather a few examples and send in a question list, after the training
 
Additional access: 
Fortigate manager write access (for Guanglin, Lynn, Leslie) 
@VESTBY, Lars
 
Thanks.

 UTM Support 
 
Hi Franck / Luc,
 
For your preparation, I’d like to understand the below during our meeting. Talk to you soon.
 
2 types of support involved:
- Deployment
- Post-deployment
 
Deployment:
- How many hours does it take to deploy 1 vessel?
- How do CCTS and network delivery interact on this?
 
Post-deployment:
- What are the common issues? How urgent are they?
- Possible to estimate how frequent a vessel encounters UTM issue? Or, how many UTM cases does CCTS get per week or month?
 
Training:
- Any documents, e.g., about deployment, activation and etc
- I presume session from Hans will be about deployment. If so, is it necessary to arrange separate ones for post-deployment cases?
- As informed by KAM, 4 deployments are planned in June, any chance for on-job training?
 
Operation:
- Any additional access that we shall get, on top of backoffice and URA? Our access to fortigate is read-only
- If it's beyond RCS capacity, will there be an 24x7 escalation point? I understand that CCTS on-duty phone is not for this purpose 
- Is it required to define a demarcation line?
