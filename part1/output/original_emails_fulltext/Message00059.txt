Hi,
 
We received a few VSAT outage alerts at 01:07 AM today as below, and all of them turned out to be false. Vessels’ VSAT was either online or only offline for a brief period of time, much less than the defined 24 hrs threshold
 
Can you please check why it happened?
 
@VESTBY, Lars
: FYI, as this may affect CMA monthly report.
