Hi,
 
We had another meeting with product manager. There is no change from existing process, but just to highlight 
that CCTS should not return the case back to RCS,
 asking for customer PO confirmation, clarification on setup and etc. They shall reach out to customer/KAM/CSE by themselves. 
 
Our job in RCS is:
 
For fleet change:
Informs the customer the change will be charged (script screenshot below), adds the KAM in copy of the ticket (for information) and asks the customer if he would like to proceed with the request. Note: the request should be from office, not vessel. 
Once the customer confirms to proceed and/
or ask for a quote
, assign the ticket to CCTS. (CCTS to advise on how long the job will take for the quotation)
 
For change on specific vessel:
 
Informs the customer the change will be charged (script below), adds the KAM in copy of the ticket (for information) and asks the customer if he would like to proceed with the request. Note: the request should be from office, not vessel. 
If customer asks for quotation, refer him to KAM. Once the customer confirms to proceed:
WAN/LAN changes: pass to MNOC Brat
Other changes: RCS makes the changes and logs the change in NetworkChangeLog in Merits
 
Be reminded that the “other changes” only consist of below items. E.g., “adding a crew account” is not included. 
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

No request from vessel
 
CCTS should go to contact KAM/customer directly, if needed, not ask RCS to do that
