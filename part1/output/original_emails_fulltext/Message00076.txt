Hi,
 
I’ve clarified with Thomas. The below is purely FYI and doesn’t change our process -  all PRA cases go to MNOC.

 Boskalis - Active on Marlink-managed BeyondTrust PRA platform
 
Hi Servicedesk
Great news, Marlink is now officially providing PRA managed services for Boskalis via Bitsiel’s BeyondTrust platform!
 
Since we consider remaining part of June a “hyper care” phase, we agreed with Boskalis to share a joint issue list: 
 Marlink PRA MSP - Hyper care Issue list.xlsx
. File should be accessible and editable for all Marlink users. 
Note! A few named Bitsiel and Boskalis users have access to this file.
 
As you can see, customer has started adding observations to this list. According to Bitsiel, the two items added as of writing this email can be addressed using the Support scripts provided as part of the training. I added the two observations below for your convenience:
#
Description
1
Downloading a file goes only to the download folder. User want to choose where to download to on their machine.
2
User was able to create new jump items
 
Considering no “Owner” is explicitly added to the items in issue list, I assume Boskalis expects Marlink to resolve even if during hyper care phase, Boskalis still has two named users with temporary admin access to the BeyondTrust portal, for enabling quick resolution of minor things. I’ve asked them to fill “Owner” going forward.
 
Also, Bitsiel has looked at the items in the list and is expecting Marlink Servicedesk to contact them for joint resolution, since this is a first for Marlink.
 
I’ll remind Boskalis to include Marlink Servicedesk in any new observations/incidents going forward, to build the right habit at the start of the operational phase.
 
Please reach out if anything unclear.
 
Vennlig hilsen / Kind regards,
Thomas
