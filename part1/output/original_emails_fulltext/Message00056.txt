Dear Coline, 
Â 
Further to our teams call, please be informed about the below:
Â 
We have received the first fleet wide change request and based on the attached document 
we have switched the case to CCTS.
Â 
Once we switched the case to CCTS, it bounced back with CCTS team informing us that there 
will be a need to redirect this request to the customerâ€™s KAM, order for KAM to quote the customer
accordingly. 
Â 
I have reached CCTS over teams where I was informed that if a customer has not NSD in place, we 
will always need to redirect such requests to sales. 
Â 
As this is not something that follows the agreed procedure, please check and clarify if something
has been misunderstood by CCTS or us. 
Â 
Thank you in advance,
