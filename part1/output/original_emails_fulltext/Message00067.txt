Hi,
 
FYI. In short, project team should contact CCCS regarding XC DNS whitelist updates and etc. Not us, like in 1808597.
 
I’ll add this to our operation doc shortly.

 RE: DNS Whitelist Update During Deployment
 
Hi Guanglin,
 
Thanks for the clarification. 
I must admit that it s sound very strange to me. DNS Whitelisting is not a new service. We are offering this since years. It seems that we never come to clarify this point. 
CCCS did manage it for Sealink + since the introduction of DNS Whitelisting for Back up configuration. 
From FE feedback, this configuration was done during deployment by FE when there was IT policy, SOW or in IOF.
It seems that nobody knows who did this in other situations… 
 
So, we need to define which department should do it now and in the future during deployment or change projects.
 
My opinion:
As soon as it s managed by a Project Manager, it should be part of the list of tasks to deploy/change via ticket to CCCS. 
CCCS knows how to do it. 
Today, CCCS receive ticket to unbar the box, receive ticket to apply a price matrix. It could be another one to apply a DNS Whitelist with the list of site to whitelist.

@LIPKA, Marek
,
Does it make sense for you? Do you have any other suggestions?
I can draft a process for this. Let me know.

 RE: DNS Whitelist Update During Deployment
 
Just to avoid any misunderstanding, this is regarding change request 
during deployment or chang project
.
 
If it’s post deployment, then it’s considered as professional service, and we will follow Coline’s process.

 DNS Whitelist Update During Deployment
 
Hi Gents,
 
The below two tickets were created by change team, requesting for DNS whitelist updates, and there are confusions on which team should be responsible for such.
 
1808597 Spirit of Sydney 
1784092 Spirit of Singapore 
 
In short, teams have different opinions:
Change team: it’s under CCCS as in attached
CCCS team: “CCCS is doing DNS white list setting only for Sealink+ Backup devices … we don't touch DNS settings on the XChange boxes”
CSE: “This is FE job”
 
RCS will complete 1808597 this time, just since it’s been pending for too long. But we need a clear guideline for future reference.
 
Thanks.
BR
Guanglin
