 RE: Support Process / BeyondTrust / BitSiel
 
Hi all
Pleased to inform Boskalis is now officially up and running on Marlink hosted BeyondTrust platform, via Bitsiel! 
 
We have agreed that Dennis de Vries and Daniel van Duuren, both from Boskalis, are temporarily promoted to administrators on the platform in a “hyper care” phase, not lasting longer than end of June. This to simplify quick actions they know how to solve without delay, as they’ll be contacted by vessels.
 
There is also an issue with the work-flow approval process via email, BeyondTrust is working on it, so this function will be disabled until confirmed working. Hopefully today already. 
I don’t expect much activity towards Marlink Support coming days, but now you know the status and I expect you’ll dispatch any non-trivial incident to Bitsiel ASAP anyway.
 
Vennlig hilsen / Kind regards,
Thomas
