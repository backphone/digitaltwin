 RE: Marlink Ticket [1783749] - Lowlands Teal - Starlink
 
Hi Shengwei
 
Also checked with Operations, and a
s long as the antenna is transferred to us, and have been online with us: we will take the ticket towards the Starlink. And if Starlink approves warrant, then we will handle it the normal way as other bought via Marlink.
 
But again this will be a bit more complicated when Starlink enforces time on how long the warranty is, when we eg don’t know the date the kit was bought originally but also how the quality was on the installation itself.
 
We had a case or two where customer had a ongoing ticket with Starlink prior to transferring the kit to us, which makes it a bit more complicated.
 
Best regards
David

 RE: Marlink Ticket [1783749] - Lowlands Teal - Starlink
 
HI Gerica,
 
When we remove a starlink and unlock it, it is no longer with us. Marlink now owns the antenna from my understanding. 
 
This is my understanding, and I am happy to be corrected.
 
@QIAN, Shengwei
 could you please clarify this.
 
For any antenna issues, we raise the ticket with Starlink for the antenna. We must select the kit no from our drop-down list in the ticket to help Starlink understand the unit that they have to provide support for.
 
This kit no is not available in our portal anymore since the antenna is handed over to Marlink.
 
The declaration of an antenna as requiring replacement is made by Starlink and not by us.
I do not have a history of this ticket with me.
 
Hence my query to know the background of the case, so that we can proceed with the next steps.
 
Best regards,

Hi Kumar
Who purchased the antenna is responsible for contacting the maker asking for warranty.
 
Marlink is manage the connectivity only in this case.
 
For this reason Shengwei contacted you.

 RE: Marlink Ticket [1783749] - Lowlands Teal - Starlink
 
Dear Shengwei,
 
Could you let me know what happened to this Unit. Typically we send a ticket to Starlink and after their investigation they declare the unit as defective and requiring replacement. They deliver the replacement.
 
In this case, I am not holding the account for this unit. The unit is under warranty. The account was transferred to you, and I assume the same with the warranty. 
Please clarify that warranty is appliable and be honoured by Marlink for all other transferred units.
 
In this case who decided that the terminal is defective? Was Starlink involved in the decision? 
 
Let us please clarify and then proceed. We should not pay for a new antenna should the old one be in warranty.
 
Best regards,
 
Kumar Sundaram

Good day all,
 
As per my understanding, we need a PO to replace faulty Starlink as hardware was not purchased from Marlink.

Dear Service Desk,
 
I realise that Starlink Kit was never supplied from Marlink for this vessel.
 
So im not sure what do you mean by replacement? If we are supplying them a new set of Starlink, then they have to purchase this set from Marlink.
 
We do not supply it as free replacement.
 
Please provide us with a PO in order from AESM to supply them a new set.
