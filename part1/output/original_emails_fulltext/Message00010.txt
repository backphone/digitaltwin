 [POP]Important information about VAS Datamanager traffic migration : NY2 to MI1
Importance:
 High
 
Dear All,
 
Well in advance, I share with you the plan set up today:
 
We have to move the whole HW/SW from NY2 to MI1 (Miami) : all maritime infra + all DC infra.
 
As a consequence, here is the temporary split of traffic from Thursday, 29
th
 of May up to Friday, 20
th
 of June:
 
NY2 POP is serving traffic for the following teleports:
ATL (Atlanta Teleport) 
 LON
HTL (Hortolandia) 
 LA2
LGS (Lurin Ground Station) 
LA2
MTN (Mountainside)  
 LA2
MTJ (Mount Jackson) 
LON
HWL (Hawley) 
LON
WMP (Washington Mediaport) 
LON
 
No outage is expected, but should you have complaints from users between the schedule above, regarding VAS DataManager, please inform DC Team + Igor, Rytis, Paul.
 
The traffic switch from NY2 to LON and LA2 will start the 29
th
 of May. All physical machines will be shut down the 30
th
 of May at the latest and will be shipped to Miami. We expect an arrival date around the 20
th
 of June.
From the 20
th
 of June, MI1 (Miami) will take the traffic as normal.
 
 
Kind Regards, Bien Cordialement,
