Registered: {ts '2025-06-12 15:23:05'} UTC

--------------------------------------------------
Dear Captain,
We sincerely apologize, as it appears there was a miscommunication earlier.
My colleague asked earlier to restart the antenna by turning antenna breaker off, can you please kindly verify if this has been done and if so, was the switch turned back on ?
Additionally, could you advise whether the antenna performed the initialization process following the restart?
  
We kindly request that you measure the voltage on the RX ACU output (Rx path), and check all related connectors for any signs of damage or irregularities along the path.
Awaiting your kind reply.
 
Best regards,
Boris Benyik

Dear Badia / Boris ,
 
Good day,
 
Please note further to below mail we are still waiting for a revert  from the support team regarding the status . We are not sure whether the issue has been resolved or not since we are unable to communicate with the vessel. We had asked for the service engineer to start communicating in a common platform (Whatsapp) so that we can see and understand the progress and provide support as required.
Vessel will be sailing from Jeddah soon and am not sure if issue can be rectified by the support team prior vessel departure. Vessel will be proceeding to Salalah , tentative ETA 17 June. 
 
Best regards,
Capt Sandeep Varma
