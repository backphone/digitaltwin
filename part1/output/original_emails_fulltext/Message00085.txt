 RE: NEW MERITS NT OP features
 
Hi guys,
 
Was below email shared with all RCS teams?
I came across few tickets were RCS points out to higher RX BBP Error Ratio, but Newtec modem software version was older than 4.7.2.1 in which case this graph is irrelevant.
 
Please share / send reminder regarding this as it seems to be confusing some people.
 
Thank you and have a good day.
Best Regards,
Adam Sevecek

 NEW MERITS NT OP features
 
Hi guys,
 
Few things implemented on NT OP page -> STATUS tab:
RX BBP Error Ratio Stats:
This feature is available 
ONLY for modems with firmware release 4.7.2.1 and newer
!
With older versions -> it will show a lot of errors, but all are false, like example below:
So it's important to check currently running modem software version.
You can trust only if modem is running 4.7.2.1 (and higher, in the future).
 
 
 
RX Link Margin:
Definition: 
Difference between the measured EsN0 and the required EsN0 to support the current MODCOD
 
 
 
Latency from HUB:
We are now able to measure two main latencies:
Latency from HUB -> description is missing for now (will be added), but it's "Latency and packet loss measured from used teleport to remote"
Latency from Eik-> Latency and packet loss measured from Eik teleport to remote
So as you can see, latency for below example from the teleport is 600 ms, but from Eik -> it's hitting almost 1000 ms:
 
IF you will have some questions, please feel free to ask.
 
BR,
Lukas
