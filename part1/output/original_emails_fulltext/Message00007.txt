 FW: CMA CGM tickets classification
 
Hi
See below.
Can You ask your teams to increace focus on creating tickets on the correct insallation based on what the problem is, and if we detect that the issue is different than the first thought (EG, thinking of a VSAT issue where , in the end, it is an ITLink issue) then modify the ticket.
 
Especially this is important for CMA CGM tickets as they have different SLA per product.
So start with the CMA tickets.
