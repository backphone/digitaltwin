Hi team,
 
Updates from RCS and RCS/MNOC meetings last night. Let me know if you have any questions.
 
RCS:
@SOH, Leslie
 during the exchange trip to Dubai, all teams (including Dubai) will need to do a briefing about how they work. E.g., in our case:
 the VSAT 1/3/5/8 structure and their responsibilities
Assign ticket/change status once we start reading a case
Whoever starts the reading 1
st
 per readlog should work on the ticket
Monthly meeting on 1
st
 Wed
Other things you can think of
 
Managed service:  a recap of the attached. 
 
We contacted 80 vessels in May, our best month this year so far. Cyber sales and Starlink migration are ahead of budget too
 
@TONG, Zax
 
@SOH, Leslie
 : tomorrow you only need to work on the tickets. Bratislava have 2 guys working on postman
 
Merits outage on Monday: root cause analysis is ongoing. P.S.: it’s highlighted and recognized that we in SG cleared the most pending emails 
 
RCS/MNOC:
Create ticket under the most relevant installation. It’s observed that some tickets were created under the wrong ones.
Boskalis PRA: 
Always create tickets under Bitsel installation under Boskalis B.V. 159282. Not under vessels. 
 
UTM support flow: just to recap the below. If you have doubts about whether it’s UTM or connectivity issues, you can forward it to MNOC Brat first. Per CCTS, 80% of UTM cases are connectivity related
