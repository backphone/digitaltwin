 RE: Recap Process and materials available - Network Solution design changes become payable from June 1st 2025
 
Hi All please see below change to the ticket handling from Coline regarding Network Solution design changes.
 
In short:
Stop informing using the script informing the customer that the change is chargeable.
Just
Register the change and process it or transfer the change to the correct team as before.
Copy also in the KAM in the ticket so they can do the information part to their customer about the offer/pricing

 Stop making reference to customers that Network Solution design changes become payable for now
 
Hi all,
 
In agreement with Management, it has been decided to stop making reference to customers that Network Solution design changes become payable from now.
If you receive change requests, they will have to be forwarded to the respective KAM so they can inform their customer about the offer. So we go back to the approach we tried to implement in February. I will work on a communication for the KAMs. 
 
In
 
the meantime, please process the change for the customer as soon as possible.
This will be done as transition period so we can maximize the amount of customers being informed about the offer by their KAM. 
Thank you for your support and understanding in this important change for our organization and customers.
 
As always, I am here to help if there is anything 
😊
 
Best regards
Coline
