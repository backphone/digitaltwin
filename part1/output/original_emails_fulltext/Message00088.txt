Dear Shengwei,
Â 
Please find attached the Master's observation email. As per the instruction, there is no need to provide internet access to any computer except the Masterâ€™s and Chief Engineerâ€™s computers.
Â 
We are aware that certain applications onboard â€” such as ADP, ENP, ECDIS, Wartsila, and Miracle â€” require internet access for updates. However, instead of providing full internet access to these computers, it is recommended to whitelist only the specific PORTs, IPs, and URLs necessary for updating these applications.
Â 
RIC Captain: Kindly arrange to provide the required IP, PORT, and URL details from the respective application makers, so that the Marlink Team can proceed with whitelisting only the necessary addresses to enable updates, without granting full internet access to other computers.
Â 
Thanks & Regards,

Good day,
I checked the traffic logs, there were some high usage from the IP addressÂ 10.200.200.223.
This device is using a machine account so there is no firewall set up.
On 5th April there is 16 GB usage on this device on LAN1 of xchange box.
Possible to find out which PC / device is using this IP address?Â 10.200.200.223
Thank you.
Best regards,

Dear Mr. Peng
Â 
Good Day,
Â 
Awiated costs for rechanrging 500 GB from 
@QIAN, Shengwei
.
Â 
Please advise â€“
the reason of very high consumption on 5th of April. On that day we have consumed data for 3 days.
Even if we counter somehow for point 1, it was clearly projected that situation is going to arise in due course, what was the action plan from Marlink to counter this very well planned issue?
If 250 GB is the limit, how we survivied suceessfully in Month of Marchâ€™25 with same data plan for vessel staff?
If we get added 500 GB for vessel, if that will be carried fwd for vessel use to next month?
Â
