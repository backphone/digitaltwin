 19.June Bratislava teambuilding
 
 
Hello Guys,
 
We will have a local teambuilding in Bratislava on 19
th
 June.
Most of the guys will want to attend so we will have really limited resources here. (1 or 2 guys might be working)
Would you be able to cover this day for us ?
 
Thank you in advance.
 
Best regards,
