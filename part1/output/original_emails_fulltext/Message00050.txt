Forti manager
- device manager
                - device groups: up error: means UTM is synced and connected to forti manager on shore. Otherwise, it means UTM is not connected, but it's still running on board; "config status": this means the config matches, not whether it's online; "policy package" : normally 1 customer 1 package
 
To check on the UTM
 
variable mapping: to check if the IPs match, especially for new deployments. Blank = take the default value
 
 
Policy & Objects
                - Policy packages (to view the submenu, need to go to tools, to turn it on)
                
                - firewall virtual: rules 1-10 are marlink default, can't be changed; LAN 1 is physical port, and vXC1 is virtual port; "security profiles" does additional checks; No. 9 is configure on cyberguard portal
                questions: no need 2 rules? just outgoing/incoming
