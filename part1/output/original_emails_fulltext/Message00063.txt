Good day, 
 
Please refer to the attached for router/switch info.
 
UPS: Cyberpower UPS 1500VA 1350W 230V. Its used to supply power to all VSAT equipment. Its the best to check with Captain or electrician onboard, if you need details on connected devices and rack space available, since our record may be out of date. 
 
I will let our network team check on the WiFi config.
 
Best regards,
Guanglin Si
