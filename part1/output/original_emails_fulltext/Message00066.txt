 RE: Level 2 Resource Required in Singapore 
 
Hi Eirik,
 
We did cover the support topic this morning. At this stage, RCS followed and have still access to the exact same training (recorded) as MNOC had. The main concern is the tool to which they do not have access yet. There is ongoing discussion between Network Engineering and Lars to deploy FMG and FAZ for RCS. As soon as the RCS team review the training and have access to tool, they could be on the same level as MNOC. 
 
Timothy should be able to proceed to deployment immediately after the training, meaning 1
st
 week of July. Guanglin and other team members from RCS will have opportunity to follow Timothy training for better understanding.
 
We agree to have a knowledge review based on tickets by end of July to demonstrate support procedures between CCTS and RCS Sing. We also agree that CCTS on duty can be called in case of need, it seems this was not clear.
 
I attached the feedback from the meeting with Guanglin this morning with a bit more of context.
 
Kind regards,

Hi,
 
Quite late, but then we need to ensure no further delays.
With this timing, what date can we say we will be ready to do;
Implementation locally (by Timothy)
Local support of solution at “reasonable” level

Hi Hans Kristian,
 
We are aiming for the 1
st
 week of July, having in mind some trainings ongoing in June for the NSD launch and some holidays in June for 3 guys (no the exact same weeks but with impact). 
I will confirm 100% before the end of the week. 
Training will take 3 half days : 1 to present globally the offer and the deployment, the two others to proceed to deployments.
We ll need in the meantime to agree on an activity follow up process.

 RE: Level 2 Resource Required in Singapore 
 
Hi Eirik
RCS have identified some seniorsin Singapore (also checking Houston) who will be handling these 2. line UTM requests.
We will have a meeting on Thursday this week with CCTS to plan the training.
But I will assume that there is some time needed for preparing the training.
 
Is there any “need by” installation date?

Hi,
 
We talked about this in our Ops meeting yesterday, but I forgot to ask about the status on the support side; do we believe we have the necessary competence to do support by RCS Singapore at a “reasonable” level? Then, I need asap a date for when our ND resource can do the implementation as outlined below.

 Fw: Level 2 Resource Required in Singapore 
 
Hi,
 
Fyi... as mentioned for you there is a request for doing implementation and some support of cyber locally from Singapore. I understand that the concrete case now will be done by CCTS within Singaporean business hours.
 
However, as it will be many more to come, potentially other customers also, I believe it would be good if we can train our ND resource to do this as well. 
 
For support it would be good if Luc and Lars can discuss what specific training of RCS Singapore that would be desired in order for cyber customers in the region to feel that there is sufficient competence locally.

 RE: Level 2 Resource Required in Singapore 
 
Hi Eirik, 
 
Good morning.  I’ve discussed with Pierre on the tasks required. As spoken for UTM deployment, it is mainly remotely configured and loaded.  Pierre and his team usually does the pre/ deployment which consists of the following tasks:
 
FortiGate Environment  
1.1  FortiGate  
1.2  FortiManager  
1.3  FortiAnalyzer  
Pre-Deployment
  
2.1  Incoming Installation and Sharepoint  
2.1.1  Merits  
2.1.2  Sharepoint  
2.2  Prerequisites: Check XChange Box Configuration  
2.2.1  XChange Box features  
2.2.2  Cloud configuration  
2.2.3  Access  
2.3  XChange Cloud Subscription  
2.4  XChange Backdoor Configuration
 
2.5  Preconfigure the FortiGate device on the FortiManager 
2.5.1 Add the FortiGate device on the FortiManager  
2.6  Configure the XChange Box  
2.6.1 By using the XChange Box WebUI via URA  
2.7  Cloud Synchronization acceleration 
 
2.8  Vessel Deployment Sheet  
 
Deployment  
3.1  Push the network template  
3.2  After deployment check list and connectivity tests 
 
3.3  Merits update  
3.3.1 Deployment ticket  
3.3.2 Edit Installation 
 
 
 
Then, we will need to look at 2 types of support requests from the customers. 
 
Issues after remote deployment of the UTM 
 
Support after vessel is live after UTM deployment 
The level 2 / future support for this role will need access to the following:
access to the back-office
access to URA
access to FMG/FAZ
 
with the above, the support colleague will pretty much be able to manage the above – with exception of adding new users in the Fortigate but we have discussed and feel this is not an urgent support case during Asia Time Zone. Adding of users can be done later by the global team. 
 
Please let me know if you have any questions, and if we should setup a follow up call on this to progress the topic further. 
 
Eastern Pacific is on their 2
nd
 POC vessel and Is still concern with the support they will receive if they go commercial. But as mentioned, the support will not just be for EPS but for ONE, OneSea, and many more. Thanks.

Hi Eirik, 
 
Good day to you. Our recent pipeline of Digital customers especially Eastern Pacific has requested heavily on local resource when it comes to UTM support. It is crucial we have someone locally then they will consider the signing of the contracts. Just to let you have an overview : 
Eastern Pacific – 150 – 200 vessels on customized UTM ( stressed critically on local resource) 
OneSea – 60- 80 vessels on standard UTM 
MEO –  100 vessels on standard UTM 
NYK 200 vessels on customized UTM ( stressed critically on local resource ) 
 
Please open the topic for discussion. I am available for a call to discuss on this topic. Thank you for looking into this request. 
 
Kind Regards,
