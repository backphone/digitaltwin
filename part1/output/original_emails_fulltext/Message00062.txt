Hi Alexis,
 
In addition to below question, can you advise why the log view menu got different sub menus and what’s the difference between them?
 
In your session, you got the 1
st
 display for Kitaura Kaiun ADOM, and 2
nd
 one for Gesco. But even if I select Gesco too, I only get the 1
st
 display.

 Fortigate Firewall Rule
 
Hi Alexis,
 
Got a question when I review the training session:
 
For each application, do we only need to define rule on one direction? E.g., for skyfile, only outgoing traffic is defined, and there is no rule for incoming.
