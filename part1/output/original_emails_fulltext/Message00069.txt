Just to avoid any misunderstanding, this is regarding change request 
during deployment or chang project
.
 
If it’s post deployment, then it’s considered as professional service, and we will follow Coline’s process.

 DNS Whitelist Update During Deployment
 
Hi Gents,
 
The below two tickets were created by change team, requesting for DNS whitelist updates, and there are confusions on which team should be responsible for such.
 
1808597 Spirit of Sydney 
1784092 Spirit of Singapore 
 
In short, teams have different opinions:
Change team: it’s under CCCS as in attached
CCCS team: “CCCS is doing DNS white list setting only for Sealink+ Backup devices … we don't touch DNS settings on the XChange boxes”
CSE: “This is FE job”
 
RCS will complete 1808597 this time, just since it’s been pending for too long. But we need a clear guideline for future reference.
 
Thanks.
BR
