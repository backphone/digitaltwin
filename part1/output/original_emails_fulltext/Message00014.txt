Hi Franck,
 
Thanks for the update. So, in term of process:
 
For Cobham terminals, we will escalate the case to MNOC if needed, with necessary info, e.g., error code, logs and preliminary checks done.
For Furuno/JRC terminals, we will escalate the ticket to CCTS directly, with the similar info
 
As I believe MNOC doesn’t have much to do in the latter case. Cc.

 RE: MSS Terminal Ownership
 
Hello Guanglin, hello Michal,
 
Let me first apologise for the late answer.
 
The rule that prevails is: we will assist customers with their MSS terminal provided they have the corresponding airtime 
or
 the purchased/leased the hardware with Marlink.
 
Down to the question related to the terminal ownership i.e. purchased from Marlink or leased from Marlink or purchased via a different provider, as long the airtime is with Marlink we will assist them in the process:
In case of a lease: we will proceed throughout until the hardware is swapped
In case of customer purchase (from Marlink), if covered with warranty we will proceed throughout, if beyond warranty will help until the identification (with manufacturer’s confirmation) of the part to be purchased and handover to the sales responsible
In case of customer purchase (from a different provider), we will help until identification (with manufacturer’s confirmation) of the part to be replaced and handover to the customer
 
When it comes to checking the terminal ownership, we rely on the details in Merits and in the vessel’s SPO. When it comes to the checking the terminal’s warranty, the MNOC was trained and knows how to check it.
 
Now, regarding the very tickets quoted in the email from Guanglin, these look to be exceptions where the process was not followed from the beginning or where there has been unusual things happening. These can’t be used as examples. I’ll let you review them in detail if you like. I actually wanted to do but I failed to have enough time to do it thoroughly.
 
Kind regards

 RE: MSS Terminal Ownership
 
Hello Franck,
 
Some more info, in ticket [1603520] , CCTS stated that customer shall handle the hardware repair by themselves, since terminal was supplied by us.
 
While in the attached case, it seems CCTS triggered the RMA, although terminal is not from us. 
 
Can you please clarify why they were handled differently?
 
Thanks. 
BR

 MSS Terminal Ownership
 
Hi Franck,
 
Can you please confirm whether CCTS can assists in FBB/Iridium terminal troubleshooting, if the terminal is not supplied by us?
 
If not, then can you please advise how to verify the terminal ownership, so that we can check about that before escalating to CCTS? According to project manager, Merits doesn’t reflect that accurately. 
 
Thanks.
Best regards,
Guanglin
