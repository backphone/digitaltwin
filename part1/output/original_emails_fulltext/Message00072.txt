 RE: UTM Support 
 
Hi Sharon,
 
It is not status quo on the support side. Based on the need for support to do smaller changes (not fleet wide!) after implementation, RCS Singapore should also have write access. Lars is in the process of getting this from Engineering.
 
And just to be clear on the overall timeline I have requested from my teams;
June; training of Timothy and RCS
July; co-operating model where both CCTS and Timothy will do implementation
From August; implementation and support to be done locally for the agreed scope

Hi Eirik, 
 
Good morning! I want to thank you for all the support you have been giving towards the setup of the support in Asia when it comes to UTM with the local customers. We have vetted the draft agreement with legal and is now ready to send to EPS for signing. They are still chasing for the date of implementation for the support.
 
I am faced with a status quo progress with the internal team, I would think these hiccups are normal. Please see the conversation below whereby the call between RCS and CCTS had a detail task illustrated with regards to the access provided to them to support customers after deployment. However, the most recent reply from Franck indicates to wake the CCTS up only for emergency situations and have Timothy support if required. I am afraid this is not what was discussed and agreed and this structure cannot be working well in my opinion.
 
Guanglin has written to Lars separately, I do not want to CC the world. Hope you can investigate and let me know on this. Thanks.  
 
Kind Regards,
Sharon ONG

Seems we/RCS are not going to get write access to UTM, and MNOC doesn’t have it too. 
That means support won’t attend customers’ non-urgent request until 4 AM UTC. For urgent ones, we can still call CCTS on-duty. 
 
You may get Timothy help you, as he will have the access, but that’s not under network delivery’s scope officially. 
 
Is this something that works for now?

Hello Guanglin,
 
This is normal: 
Timothy is to help us in deployment activity, not in the support activity
. For support activities there’s RCS > MNOC 
24/7
 > CCTS On-Call Duty in case something is an urgent matter and can’t wait until 04:00 UTC. 
 
Kind regards

 RE: UTM Support 
 
Hi Luc,
 
I understand from Lars that there are some challenges in granting the RCS team write access
, and the plan is that only Timothy will have this access and will provide support to customers when required.
 
Could you please confirm if the Network Delivery team has agreed to this arrangement? As far as I know, they are typically not involved in customer support after deployment.
 
As understood from our meeting, the majority of UTM tickets are rule update requests. Since the Sales team has committed to providing customers with prompt local support, we may need to call the CCTS duty phone when Timothy is unavailable, if we don’t have write access.
 
Thanks.

 RE: UTM Support 
 
Hi All,
 
Please find the meeting minutes below. Feel free to add in if anything is missed.
 
Understanding: 
No major UTM post-deployment incidents reported so far. CCTS only received change requests.  
Under normal circumstances, CCTS prepares VM and relevant XC/Fortigate configuration in advance, and hand them over to network delivery. 
RCS SG is not required for deployment activities. Process details will be covered during the training.
Once activated, RCS will follow the same checklist previously shared by Alexis, focusing on connectivity, XChange configuration, etc.
Escalation path: Connectivity issues -> MNOC,  XC/UTM cases-> CCTS. For urgent cases, contact CCTS 24x7 on-duty
 
Action items:
Training/Follow-up sessions:
By end of June:
 RCS SG to review the training done by Alexis / 
@SI, Guanglin
1st week of July:
  deployment training for Timothy. Selected RCS SG members will attend or review that for understanding./ 
@FERON, Luc
 
@VESTBY, Lars
 to coordinate with network team on the training date
2nd week of July:
  arrange a sync session among local network, RCS, KAM and SM in SG  / 
@SI, Guanglin
  
By end of July
: Frank to arrange for a go through of 10 CCTS tickets transferred to CCTS, to demonstrate troubleshooting procedures, and explain about the mechanism between UTM and Xchange. / 
@ARGANESE, Franck
 P.S. 
@SI, Guanglin
 will try to gather a few examples and send in a question list, after the training
 
Additional access: 
Fortigate manager write access (for Guanglin, Lynn, Leslie) 
@VESTBY, Lars
 
Thanks.
BR

 UTM Support 
 
Hi Franck / Luc,
 
For your preparation, I’d like to understand the below during our meeting. Talk to you soon.
 
2 types of support involved:
- Deployment
- Post-deployment
 
Deployment:
- How many hours does it take to deploy 1 vessel?
- How do CCTS and network delivery interact on this?
 
Post-deployment:
- What are the common issues? How urgent are they?
- Possible to estimate how frequent a vessel encounters UTM issue? Or, how many UTM cases does CCTS get per week or month?
 
Training:
- Any documents, e.g., about deployment, activation and etc
- I presume session from Hans will be about deployment. If so, is it necessary to arrange separate ones for post-deployment cases?
- As informed by KAM, 4 deployments are planned in June, any chance for on-job training?
 
Operation:
- Any additional access that we shall get, on top of backoffice and URA? Our access to fortigate is read-only
- If it's beyond RCS capacity, will there be an 24x7 escalation point? I understand that CCTS on-duty phone is not for this purpose 
- Is it required to define a demarcation line?
 
BR
Guanglin
