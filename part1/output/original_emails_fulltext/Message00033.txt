Hi guys,
 
We have seen a few duplicate tickets, please check if there is any existing ticket, before creating a new one.
 
Especially for “
Traffic Monitor Notification Action Certus xxxx  has fired” on MSS or VSAT/starlink outage notification, 
very often, there is already an incident ticket opened for those.
