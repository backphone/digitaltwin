Hi Coline / Alex /Amrine,
 
Can you please confirm whether we shall manage crew accounts on customer behalf? And if yes, how to log that?
 
Thanks.

 Re: Network Changelog - non-Machine accounts
 
Hi Guanglin, 
 
Thanks for your email :). 
 
It is indeed not foreseen as a payable change as part of this offer. 
It shouldn’t be logged as “Add a machine account”, otherwise it will be invoiced as a Network solution design change to the customer.
 
In my opinion, we shouldn’t manage crew accounts on behalf of the customer (at least not for free). 
I copy Amrine as she is PM for crew portfolio and Alex is for XChange.
 
FYI 
@KRCMA, Alexander
 
@BEPARI, Amrine
 Any thoughts to share?
 
 
Thanks
 
Best regards
 
Coline

 Network Changelog - non-Machine accounts
 
 
Hi Coline,
 
FYI, quite often, we are asked by customer to manage crew accounts on their behalf, and it seems there is no such option in the network changelog. 
 
For now, we are using “adding machine account” in changelog to capture such change. Please let me know if that is fine, or we should reject such request.
