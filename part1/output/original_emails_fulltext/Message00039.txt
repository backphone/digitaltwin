Hi Krys,
 
Are you in contact with Fadi on this? Or, I can drop him a message.

 Re: 1 Edge Server
 
Hi Guanglin,
 
Definitely 1 box at least.
We could reach out to SEKKYNEH, Fadi during June to get an internal issue approval.

 Re: 1 Edge Server
 
Hi Guanglin,
 
1Edge/XCNG is still pending to release. Soft launch is expected mid this month. 
I believe Wilson will need to provide training, therefore we could plan for arrangements probably in June when things are more definitive.
Ideally, we would like to have 2 boxes:
Singapore Office VSAT connection - 1 Unit 
Singapore Office Internet connection - 1 Unit
 
Keep in mind that licensing distributed for internal use could be limited therefore we may not be able to get the box(es) as soon as we hope.

Hi Krys / Wilson,
 
Is there any plan to get a server here for demo and testing? What model?
