Hi Daven,
 
Checked April & May logs, and the data consumption patterns are the same
 
Crew group consumes the most data of about 70%
The top users include ‘master’, ‘ab1’, ‘ab2’, ‘bridge’. Note that ‘aster’ alone consumed about 40GB in May.
 
Although there are a few tickets opened earlier, we still don't have a clear picture of the issue nature. Once FX is online, we can try to do a thorough investigation.
