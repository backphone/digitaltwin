Hi 
As the alerting of “all SNG barriers are down” now is active for all custome
rs I am sharing the latest SNG cold backup activation procedure attached.
 
Please share with Your teams so they can familiarize themselves with the details in the MSS standby process.
RCS tasks in short:
Receive alert mail and create ticket 
Troubleshoot connectivity
If unsuccessful troubleshooting, create 2 sub tickets to MSS BO: One for SIM activation and one for evaluating if the customer should be shared for the activation.
When resolved notification is received created sub ticket to MSS BO for deactivation of SIM. 
 
The following alert mails are sent to 
servicedesk@marlink.com
 in case of outage:
 
After 1 hour down FIREING notification will come,
There is a RESOLVED notification sent right after the issue is confirmed resolved. (
The criteria is for one bearer to be online again -+9 min because it checks status every 10min).
