Hi,
 
Here are the updates from meeting last night:
 
Voice@marlink result is released. Overall, our score is stable. We will review that next Wednesday
Company is putting more resources on the ABC strategy, and more sales have been hired for IT products
Regarding the attached PRA solution, we just need to create a ticket for MNOC Brat, and they will start the migration from 3rd solution gradually to ours
It’s highlighted again that we shall create ticket under the correct installation, especially for Boskalis/CMA, since different services, e.g. VSAT/ITlink, have different SLAs
 
About attached crew account management topic: across RCS teams, we agree that:
If we are creating a customized crew group for the customer, then we can help them create accounts, or preferably, demonstrate them how they can create accounts on portal, e.g., via a Teamviewer session, so that they can do it themselves. Since customer will be charged (for the group creation, which should be documented in network changelog), we can spend more time on this.
If the request is purely concerning crew accounts, we shall suggest customer use P360. You can apply your judgement on this and decide when you do or don’t create accounts on customer behalf in this case. Personally, I’d tend to be more “understanding”, if it’s for our regional customers, e.g., NYK/EPS
 
We are still in the discussion with PM on this, to get it clarified.
