Hi Erik / Michal,
 
Has MNOC Brat got additional UTM training, on top of the one conducted by CCTS on 25
th
 April? If so, can you please share the recording with me?
 
Background: Due to local customers’ demand, RCS SG team has been asked to take some of CCTS UTM responsibilities. Based on our discussion with CCTS team so far, that mostly means RCS SG needs to handle some UTM firewall/DNS update requests, and this new arrangement shouldn’t affect MNOC per the existing process below. It’s not fully finalized yet, and I’ll keep you updated if there is any change.
 
We target to get this ready by August.
