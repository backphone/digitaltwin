 RE: MERITS Postman Guide
Â 
Hi both,
Â 
Thanks for your efforts on that one.
Â 
I understand that we leave the MERITS Postman document in KB, 
@BORDA, Shantal
 to finalize the latest updates following your call.
Â 
This is great.
Â 
@SI, Guanglin
 â€“ I would propose to take section related to Postman out of your Guide and to add a link to the other document to be sure we only need to update one and have all information in it. Whenever you think it needs an update, you can let Shantal or me know and we will process. Would that be ok for you?
Â 
Best regards / Salutations / Mit freundlichen GrÃ¼ssen,

 RE: MERITS Postman Guide
Â 
Hi Guanglin, 
Â 
Thank you again for taking the time to go over the MERITS Postman article and its updates. 
ðŸ˜Š
Â 
Hi Katrin, 
Â 
Here are some of the of the changes/ additions to include in the document:
Â 
Updates:
Â 
3. Email Features
To add new feature - #18 
New Reminder
 button
Â 
5.2 Ticket Creation 
Old text:
 
The person who creates the ticket shall initiate the first response to inform the customer about the ticket creation and then work on the case.
Â 
Updated:
 
If the procedure applies to the team, it is possible that the person who creates the ticket will also work on the case/ ticket and communicate with the customer. In some teams, a specific team member is mainly assigned to create the tickets only.
Â 
Â 
The following sections from the document will be 
removed
 since they are not related in any way to the Postman process:
Â 
5.4.1. IT Issues for EIK Vessels
 â€“ process/ flow chart 
Â 
5.8.1 Update VSAT Outage Email List 
Â 
Â 
Once I go over the call in more detail, Iâ€™ll share any additional updates/ changes not yet included above. 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Â 
Warm Regards,Â 
Â 
ShantalÂ
