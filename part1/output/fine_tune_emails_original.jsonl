DNS Whitelisting is not a new service. We are offering this since years. It seems that we never come to clarify this point. \nCCCS did manage it for Sealink + since the introduction of DNS Whitelisting for Back up configuration. \nFrom FE feedback, this configuration was done during deployment by FE when there was IT policy, SOW or in IOF.\nIt seems that nobody knows who did this in other situations\u2026 \n\u00a0\nSo, we need to define which department should do it now and in the future during deployment or change projects.\n\u00a0\nMy opinion:\nAs soon as it s managed by a Project Manager, it should be part of the list of tasks to deploy/change via ticket to CCCS. \nCCCS knows how to do it. \nToday, CCCS receive ticket to unbar the box, receive ticket to apply a price matrix. It could be another one to apply a DNS Whitelist with the list of site to whitelist.\n\u00a0\n@VESTBY, Lars\n, \n@LIPKA, Marek\n,\nDoes it make sense for you?

File should be accessible and editable for all Marlink users. \nNote! A few named Bitsiel and Boskalis users have access to this file.\n\u00a0\nAs you can see, customer has started adding observations to this list. According to Bitsiel, the two items added as of writing this email can be addressed using the Support scripts provided as part of the training. I added the two observations below for your convenience:\n#\nDescription\n1\nDownloading a file goes only to the download folder. User want to choose where to download to on their machine.\n2\nUser was able to create new jump items\n\u00a0\nConsidering no \u201cOwner\u201d is explicitly added to the items in issue list, I assume Boskalis expects Marlink to resolve even if during hyper care phase, Boskalis still has two named users with temporary admin access to the BeyondTrust portal, for enabling quick resolution of minor things. I\u2019ve asked them to fill \u201cOwner\u201d going forward.\n\u00a0\nAlso, Bitsiel has looked at the items in the list and is expecting Marlink Servicedesk to contact them for joint resolution, since this is a first for Marlink.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ll remind Boskalis to include Marlink Servicedesk in any new observations/incidents going forward, to build the right habit at the start of the operational phase.\n\u00a0\nPlease reach out if anything unclear.\n\u00a0\nVennlig hilsen / Kind regards,\nThomas\n\u00a0\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThomas Busk Jacobsen\nDigital Pre Sales \nM:\n +47 9575 8550\n\u00a0\nDigitally advancing your remote world by creating Possibilities.

When it comes to the checking the terminal\u2019s warranty, the MNOC was trained and knows how to check it.\n\u00a0\nNow, regarding the very tickets quoted in the email from Guanglin, these look to be exceptions where the process was not followed from the beginning or where there has been unusual things happening.

It is scheduled to run at 8AM UTC daily.\nData are from database \u2018tss-subscriber-prd\u2019 \u00a0at server \u2018we-prd-operations-kpis.database.windows.net\u2019. You can request for the access from IMSD, then you can use power BI to build such reports. \n\u00a0\nThe above dashboard is for monitoring the ongoing tickets. If you want to see how workload is distributed in a longer term, then we can check how many tickets each member closes too. Right now, I use the attached excel, but we should be able to make a dashboard rather easily.\n\u00a0\nA limitation I face is, that SQL database doesn\u2019t have historical statistics. E.g., I can check how many open tickets we have now, but not yesterday. Thus, it\u2019s difficult to show the changing trend. It seems you managed to solve that with Grafana. Did you build those dashboards by yourself? I tried that, but don\u2019t have the access.

I am seeing it specially on CMA CGM Tickets - see \n1807331 - CMA CGM Pegasus\n\u00a0and \n1796621 - CMA CGM Tigris\n\u00a0as examples.\n\u00a0\nSee details of the issue:\nCustomer usually reaches us complaining about the Wi-Fi network (low performance, frequent disconnections and others).\nStarting the troubleshoot, we check that there is some Wi-Fi APs that cannot be reached on the network. We ask customer to restart, check MACs, and more...\n\u00a0\nThis issue is caused because the Wi-Fi APs returned to the factory default IP (192.168.0.50) or even returned to all factory settings after a power cycle. Since vessel have at least three APs, they started to conflict between them because of the equal IP, leading to disconnections and other issues.\n\u00a0\nSee below the procedure to access the Wi-Fi APs over their factory IP and restore their access over the LAN2 configured network (note that this procedure will lead to total disconnection of the Wi-Fi network on the vessel over the time spent on the configurations - around 1h, depending on the connection speed).\n\u00a0\nAccess the vessel's\u00a0 XChange Box URA. Access the XChange Web page and go to \nBox Settings -> Network -> LAN/WAN\n.\nCreate a new temporary LAN calles APs, like below:\nNow, assign this LAN to the LAN2 interface and restart the XChange Box.\nNOTE\u00b9\n\u00a0- \nDO NOT\n\u00a0make this configuration over the Start Wizard, since it can change the decides priorities.\nNOTE\u00b2\n\u00a0- You can do this kind of configuration on XChange v5.4.0 and v5.5.0 too, but you need to save all LAN2 configurations before the change, since the function of create several separated LANs only arrived on v5.6.0.\n\u00a0\nAfter the restart, access the XChange Box again. Go to the internet browser and access the AP web page over the IP 192.168.0.50:\nThe User Name is always \nadmin\n. password can be \nstddzWIFI \nor \nstddzWIFI2020 \n(most actual one) or leave password blank.\n\u00a0\nAt the left menu, go to \nBasic Setting -> LAN\n. Select Static IP and set an IP on the LAN2 that is free (In this case, 10.0.2.111) and click save.\u00a0\nNOTE \n-\n\u00a0DO NOT\n\u00a0set DHCP. If you set DCHP now, it will try to get an IP and it will not find and return to the factory IP.\n\u00a0\nIMPORTANT!!!\n\u00a0- After that, go to \nConfiguration \nand click \nSave and Activate\n. The AP will restart.\nIf you don't click on Save and Activate, the AP will not save the configuration to the flash memory and after a power cycle, these setting will be lost.\n\u00a0\nIf there is more then one AP with the factory default IP, reload the page with 192.168.0.50 and you will access the next one. Repeat the steps 4, 5 and 6 and set another fixed IP (10.0.2.112, for example) to this new AP. Keep doing that until you do not find any APs on this network anymore. You can let a command prompt window with the command \"ping 192.168.0.50 -t\" running to see if you can still find any AP on the network.\n\u00a0\nAfter you set them, return to the XChange Web Page and return the LAN2 to the LAN2 interface\nAfter that, delete the AP LAN previously created:\nRestart the XChange again.\n\u00a0\nAfter the restart, the APs will be accessible correctly now. Access them over the new IP address set, change the password to stddzWIFI2020 and configured just as the commissioning guide \n\"20200323 XChange WiFi configuration manual v12.5.pdf\"\n.\nDo not forget to click \nSave and Activate\n\u00a0at the end of the configuration!!!\n\u00a0\nWith these steps, you will standardize the Wi-FI APs configuration at the vessel and eliminate the IP conflict between them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you have any doubts regarding this procedure, let me know \n\ud83d\ude42\n\u00a0\n-----------------------------------------------------\nBest Regards\nThales Trabbold\nRCS Support Engineer - Rio de Janeiro\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDigitally advancing your remote world by creating Possibilities.

By that, they mean support on both incident and change request. As we learnt during the meeting, post-deployment tickets have so far only involved change requests, thus, write access is essential. I believe Lars is working on that.\n\u00a0\nRegarding training, the global RCS team attended a UTM session on 25th April hosted by Alexis, together with MNOC, and we are currently reviewing the material. Please advise if there has been any additional training specifically for MNOC. If the 25\nth\n session was the only one provided to MNOC, then theoretically, both global RCS and MNOC would have a similar level of UTM knowledge. Based on that, I understand the local support arrangement means RCS SG will cover part of CCTS\u2019s scope, not MNOC\u2019s.\n\u00a0\nThis also aligns with the flowchart shared by the product team, which indicates that UTM issues don\u2019t require routing through MNOC. \n\u00a0\nThat said, I fully understand that MNOC generally has stronger technical expertise and is more focused on troubleshooting. It\u2019s understandable if CCTS prefers MNOC to review UTM tickets first. In that case, we\u2019ll just need to update the process chart accordingly to ensure clarity.

The context today, as far as we know, is that support is organized with RCS L1, MNOC L2 and CCTS L3. \nFor UTM, I ve been asked, due to specific needs in Asia region, to train local Network Delivery team member on deployment. This is ongoing.\nI ve been asked to train local support team at a reasonable level. We did understand at the level of MNOC. So, we invited you and your team to review the training provided to MNOC and to have access to the same tool. We ll also add some missing info related to Xchange config identified as not covered during the initial training.\nFrom our experience, following the past deployments, there was no issue with UTM. The only ones were linked to missing rules during deployment. This means change management for UTM.\nI did not understand that RCS will do change management. For sure, if it s the goal, RCS will need write access, on top of it, a training will be necessary to proceed changes, to update documentation accordingly, to maintain fleet policy \u2026.\n\u00a0\nThis decision is out of my scope. \n@VESTBY, Lars\n , do you have more info on the organization Eirik would like to have in place locally?\n\u00a0\nKind regards,\n\u00a0\nLuc Feron\nDirector Competence Centers \nMarlink SAS \nCECS Aussaguel\n31450 Issus \u2013 France\nM +33 (0)6 71 04 65 04\nE\u00a0 \nluc.feron@marlink.com\nwww.marlink.com\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDigitally advancing your remote world by creating Possibilities.

File should be accessible and editable for all Marlink users. \nNote! A few named Bitsiel and Boskalis users have access to this file.\n\u00a0\nAs you can see, customer has started adding observations to this list. According to Bitsiel, the two items added as of writing this email can be addressed using the Support scripts provided as part of the training. I added the two observations below for your convenience:\n#\nDescription\n1\nDownloading a file goes only to the download folder. User want to choose where to download to on their machine.\n2\nUser was able to create new jump items\n\u00a0\nConsidering no \u201cOwner\u201d is explicitly added to the items in issue list, I assume Boskalis expects Marlink to resolve even if during hyper care phase, Boskalis still has two named users with temporary admin access to the BeyondTrust portal, for enabling quick resolution of minor things. I\u2019ve asked them to fill \u201cOwner\u201d going forward.\n\u00a0\nAlso, Bitsiel has looked at the items in the list and is expecting Marlink Servicedesk to contact them for joint resolution, since this is a first for Marlink.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ll remind Boskalis to include Marlink Servicedesk in any new observations/incidents going forward, to build the right habit at the start of the operational phase.\n\u00a0\nPlease reach out if anything unclear.\n\u00a0\nVennlig hilsen / Kind regards,\nThomas\n\u00a0\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThomas Busk Jacobsen\nDigital Pre Sales \nM:\n +47 9575 8550\n\u00a0\nDigitally advancing your remote world by creating Possibilities.

How urgent are they?\n- Possible to estimate how frequent a vessel encounters UTM issue? Or, how many UTM cases does CCTS get per week or month?\n\u00a0\nTraining:\n- Any documents, e.g., about deployment, activation and etc\n- I presume session from Hans will be about deployment. If so, is it necessary to arrange separate ones for post-deployment cases?\n- As informed by KAM, 4 deployments are planned in June, any chance for on-job training?\n\u00a0\nOperation:\n- Any additional access that we shall get, on top of backoffice and URA? Our access to fortigate is read-only\n- If it's beyond RCS capacity, will there be an 24x7 escalation point?

I fowarded to Houston RCS, but I'll ask to foward to all RCS.\n\u00a0\nDe:\n\u00a0TRABBOLD, Thales <\nThales.Trabbold@marlink.com\n>\nEnviado:\n\u00a0quarta-feira, 11 de junho de 2025 17:45\nPara:\n\u00a0Team RCS Houston <\nTeam.RCSHouston@marlink.com\n>\nAssunto:\n\u00a0How to configured factory default D-Link Wi-Fi APs\n\u00a0\nHello team,\n\u00a0\nI am sharing a procedure that can help us on a lot of tickets. I am seeing it specially on CMA CGM Tickets - see \n1807331 - CMA CGM Pegasus\n\u00a0and \n1796621 - CMA CGM Tigris\n\u00a0as examples.\n\u00a0\nSee details of the issue:\nCustomer usually reaches us complaining about the Wi-Fi network (low performance, frequent disconnections and others).\nStarting the troubleshoot, we check that there is some Wi-Fi APs that cannot be reached on the network. We ask customer to restart, check MACs, and more...\n\u00a0\nThis issue is caused because the Wi-Fi APs returned to the factory default IP (192.168.0.50) or even returned to all factory settings after a power cycle. Since vessel have at least three APs, they started to conflict between them because of the equal IP, leading to disconnections and other issues.\n\u00a0\nSee below the procedure to access the Wi-Fi APs over their factory IP and restore their access over the LAN2 configured network (note that this procedure will lead to total disconnection of the Wi-Fi network on the vessel over the time spent on the configurations - around 1h, depending on the connection speed).\n\u00a0\nAccess the vessel's\u00a0 XChange Box URA. Access the XChange Web page and go to \nBox Settings -> Network -> LAN/WAN\n.\nCreate a new temporary LAN calles APs, like below:\nNow, assign this LAN to the LAN2 interface and restart the XChange Box.\nNOTE\u00b9\n\u00a0- \nDO NOT\n\u00a0make this configuration over the Start Wizard, since it can change the decides priorities.\nNOTE\u00b2\n\u00a0- You can do this kind of configuration on XChange v5.4.0 and v5.5.0 too, but you need to save all LAN2 configurations before the change, since the function of create several separated LANs only arrived on v5.6.0.\n\u00a0\nAfter the restart, access the XChange Box again. Go to the internet browser and access the AP web page over the IP 192.168.0.50:\nThe User Name is always \nadmin\n. password can be \nstddzWIFI \nor \nstddzWIFI2020 \n(most actual one) or leave password blank.\n\u00a0\nAt the left menu, go to \nBasic Setting -> LAN\n. Select Static IP and set an IP on the LAN2 that is free (In this case, 10.0.2.111) and click save.\u00a0\nNOTE \n-\n\u00a0DO NOT\n\u00a0set DHCP. If you set DCHP now, it will try to get an IP and it will not find and return to the factory IP.\n\u00a0\nIMPORTANT!!!\n\u00a0- After that, go to \nConfiguration \nand click \nSave and Activate\n. The AP will restart.\nIf you don't click on Save and Activate, the AP will not save the configuration to the flash memory and after a power cycle, these setting will be lost.\n\u00a0\nIf there is more then one AP with the factory default IP, reload the page with 192.168.0.50 and you will access the next one. Repeat the steps 4, 5 and 6 and set another fixed IP (10.0.2.112, for example) to this new AP. Keep doing that until you do not find any APs on this network anymore. You can let a command prompt window with the command \"ping 192.168.0.50 -t\" running to see if you can still find any AP on the network.\n\u00a0\nAfter you set them, return to the XChange Web Page and return the LAN2 to the LAN2 interface\nAfter that, delete the AP LAN previously created:\nRestart the XChange again.\n\u00a0\nAfter the restart, the APs will be accessible correctly now. Access them over the new IP address set, change the password to stddzWIFI2020 and configured just as the commissioning guide \n\"20200323 XChange WiFi configuration manual v12.5.pdf\"\n.\nDo not forget to click \nSave and Activate\n\u00a0at the end of the configuration!!!\n\u00a0\nWith these steps, you will standardize the Wi-FI APs configuration at the vessel and eliminate the IP conflict between them.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nIf you have any doubts regarding this procedure, let me know \n\ud83d\ude42\n\u00a0\n-----------------------------------------------------\nBest Regards\nThales Trabbold\nRCS Support Engineer - Rio de Janeiro\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDigitally advancing your remote world by creating Possibilities.

Talk to you soon.\n\u00a0\n2 types of support involved:\n- Deployment\n- Post-deployment\n\u00a0\nDeployment:\n- How many hours does it take to deploy 1 vessel?\n- How do CCTS and network delivery interact on this?\n\u00a0\nPost-deployment:\n- What are the common issues? How urgent are they?\n- Possible to estimate how frequent a vessel encounters UTM issue? Or, how many UTM cases does CCTS get per week or month?\n\u00a0\nTraining:\n- Any documents, e.g., about deployment, activation and etc\n- I presume session from Hans will be about deployment. If so, is it necessary to arrange separate ones for post-deployment cases?\n- As informed by KAM, 4 deployments are planned in June, any chance for on-job training?\n\u00a0\nOperation:\n- Any additional access that we shall get, on top of backoffice and URA? Our access to fortigate is read-only\n- If it's beyond RCS capacity, will there be an 24x7 escalation point? I understand that CCTS on-duty phone is not for this purpose \n- Is it required to define a demarcation line?\n\u00a0\nBR\nGuanglin"}

I\u2019ve asked them to fill \u201cOwner\u201d going forward.\n\u00a0\nAlso, Bitsiel has looked at the items in the list and is expecting Marlink Servicedesk to contact them for joint resolution, since this is a first for Marlink.\n\u00a0\nI\u2019ll remind Boskalis to include Marlink Servicedesk in any new observations/incidents going forward, to build the right habit at the start of the operational phase.\n\u00a0\nPlease reach out if anything unclear.\n\u00a0\nVennlig hilsen / Kind regards,\nThomas\n\u00a0\n-----------------------------------------------------\nThomas Busk Jacobsen\nDigital Pre Sales \nM:\n +47 9575 8550\n\u00a0\nDigitally advancing your remote world by creating Possibilities.

I want to thank you for all the support you have been giving towards the setup of the support in Asia when it comes to UTM with the local customers.

Please keep an eye on them to monitor the report accuracy.\nTTO \u00a0\nDashboard link\nTTU \u00a0\nDashboard link\nAll timestamps are in UTC.\nTTO:\nThis updates at 12 AM every day, and consists of two parts:\nA table listing all RCS tickets that violated TTO in the past 24 hours\nDefault TTO is 120 mins, \u00a0except 60 mins on CMA and 30 mins on Boskalis. \nHourly average TTO trend across the last 24 hours\n\u00a0\nThis dashboard only monitors tickets created by RCS.\n\u00a0\nData on 9\nth\n May, captured yesterday:\n\u00a0\nNote:\nTime reference is based on the email received timestamp (InDateTime)\nTimestamps are rounded down to the hour (e.g., 01:59 AM is grouped under 1 AM). This setting can be adjusted later if needed.\nFull ticket list can be found on \nDetailed ticket table\n, for cross checking.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nTTU \nThis report captures TTU every 4 hrs, 6 times a day, and it only checks on \u201cin progress\u201d & unassigned RCS tickets.\nColumn charts show the longest delay since \nthe last ticket action\n. \nE.g., at 12 AM UTC 10\nth\n May, ticket 1782530 had the longest delay, of 16.2 hrs\nSimilarly, 4 hrs later, at 4 AM, out of all RCS tickets, ticket 1760491 had the longest delay, of 4.3 hrs \nThe 3 delayed tickets are displayed underneath the chart, for cross checking\nThis dashboard is a collection of 6 induvial reports, each refreshing at different hours, as indicated by \u201cSnapshothour\u201d. \n\u00a0E.g., the 3\nst\n one, Snapshot 8 means that report updates at 8 AM daily. So, if I check that at 4AM here, then I\u2019m still seeing yesterday\u2019s data, so 0.9 was what we left with \nyesterday\n. But if Rasto checks that at 10AM, then that report should have already updated, so it will show what they start with \ntoday\n\u00a0\nThis is the same logic that Merits dashboard uses. E.g., at 12 AM, 1782530 was on the top of our dashboard:\n\u00a0\nLimitations:\u00a0 \nDue to some licensing constraints, TTU dashboard only records the data for last 24 hrs, and we can\u2019t backtrace further or adjust the time frame easily. \nIt\u2019s known that above logic may underestimate TTU, since it only checks the last action, not the last customer incoming email. I have made another dashboard based on ticket Changelog\u00a0 \nDashboard link\n, which calculates how long the ticket has been in \u201cIn Progress\u201d status, but for now, I suggest use the one above for consistency , as it aligns with how Merits works\n\u00a0\n@TSOTRAS, Antonios\n Your teams are not yet included in these dashboards, as they are under a different Merits Resource ID. If helpful, I can add your team in, or you can refer to my Wednesday email and set up your own version. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll enjoy that.\nThanks.\nBR\nGuanglin"}

Since then, we have worked on upgrading our administration tools\u00a0 and we are now ready to proceed with this migration as per Inmarsat\u2019s recommendations. \n\u00a0\nWe want to remind you that: \nSafetyLink will connect to the ITU Maritime Mobile Access and Retrieval System (MARS) website so radio licensing can be checked by all stakeholders in real time, helping to ensure the validity of the terminal\u2019s registration. \nThe vessel owner will be invoiced by Marlink, as their Preferred Land Earth Station Operator (PLESO). \nF\nor most of the countries, it will \nno longer be necessary to use a Point of Service Activation (PSA) entity to activate or change any details of the activation. \nOnce moved to the SafetyLink portal, your Inm-C terminals will only\n \nbe able to connect to the Preferred LESO stations, being Marlink Land Earth Station in Aussaguel (LES id21) or Eik (LES id04). This migration will protect Inm-C terminal owners from higher roaming costs. \nNote that the working of the GMDSS distress signal is not impacted by this change. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat if you do not agree with the migration:\nIf you do not agree that your Inm-C terminals are migrated to SafetyLink, you shall notify Marlink by \nFriday 20\nth\n of June 2025\n at the latest. Marlink will not migrate your terminal from ESAS (Inmarsat legacy system) and you will risk higher roaming costs. \nBesides, if your terminal does not migrate to SafetyLink, an additional Inmarsat charge shall then apply at \nten dollars ($10)\n per terminal per month from \n1\nst\n of July 2025\n.\nThis letter shall serve as a price increase notification per Marlink General Terms and Conditions in case you withhold your consent. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat to Expect\nOur team is committed to making the transition as seamless as possible. Over the coming weeks, you can reach out to our Inmarsat-C expert team \u00a0to get guidance from our \u00a0support team throughout the process.\n\u00a0\nHow to Prepare\nTo ensure a smooth transition, we recommend that you:\nReview your current Inmarsat-C terminal setup and more specifically that you make sure that your Inmarsat-C terminal uses one of the two Marlink Inmarsat-C Land Earth Station : \nAussaguel (LES id21) or Eik (LES id04). \nKeep your contact details up to date with our customer service team so that you receive timely updates and assistance.\n\u00a0\nNeed Help?\nWe understand that transitions can sometimes be challenging, and we are here to support you every step of the way.

Since then, we have worked on upgrading our administration tools\u00a0 and we are now ready to proceed with this migration as per Inmarsat\u2019s recommendations. \n\u00a0\nWe want to remind you that: \nSafetyLink will connect to the ITU Maritime Mobile Access and Retrieval System (MARS) website so radio licensing can be checked by all stakeholders in real time, helping to ensure the validity of the terminal\u2019s registration. \nThe vessel owner will be invoiced by Marlink, as their Preferred Land Earth Station Operator (PLESO). \nF\nor most of the countries, it will \nno longer be necessary to use a Point of Service Activation (PSA) entity to activate or change any details of the activation. \nOnce moved to the SafetyLink portal, your Inm-C terminals will only\n \nbe able to connect to the Preferred LESO stations, being Marlink Land Earth Station in Aussaguel (LES id21) or Eik (LES id04). This migration will protect Inm-C terminal owners from higher roaming costs. \nNote that the working of the GMDSS distress signal is not impacted by this change. \u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat if you do not agree with the migration:\nIf you do not agree that your Inm-C terminals are migrated to SafetyLink, you shall notify Marlink by \nFriday 20\nth\n of June 2025\n at the latest. Marlink will not migrate your terminal from ESAS (Inmarsat legacy system) and you will risk higher roaming costs. \nBesides, if your terminal does not migrate to SafetyLink, an additional Inmarsat charge shall then apply at \nten dollars ($10)\n per terminal per month from \n1\nst\n of July 2025\n.\nThis letter shall serve as a price increase notification per Marlink General Terms and Conditions in case you withhold your consent. \n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nWhat to Expect\nOur team is committed to making the transition as seamless as possible. Over the coming weeks, you can reach out to our Inmarsat-C expert team \u00a0to get guidance from our \u00a0support team throughout the process.\n\u00a0\nHow to Prepare\nTo ensure a smooth transition, we recommend that you:\nReview your current Inmarsat-C terminal setup and more specifically that you make sure that your Inmarsat-C terminal uses one of the two Marlink Inmarsat-C Land Earth Station : \nAussaguel (LES id21) or Eik (LES id04). \nKeep your contact details up to date with our customer service team so that you receive timely updates and assistance.\n\u00a0\nNeed Help?\nWe understand that transitions can sometimes be challenging, and we are here to support you every step of the way. If you have any questions or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our dedicated support team at \nservicesdesk@marlink.com\n .\nThank you for your continued trust in Marlink.
