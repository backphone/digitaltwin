-- NOTE: This query calculates how long a ticket has remained continuously in 'In Progress' status.
-- It assumes that tblProblemChangeLog reliably logs all status changes.
-- However, if a ticket's status is changed (e.g., to 'Waiting on Customer') but not recorded in the changelog,
-- the algorithm may mistakenly assume the ticket is still in progress since the last 'In Progress' event.
-- This may cause some tickets that are actually in 'In Progress' to be excluded from the result if the changelog is incomplete. 
-- Simplified logic: we rely on tblProblem to identify currently active 'In Progress' tickets, and we check the latest log to ensure alignment.
-- If the last ticket changelog entry shows that the ticket was 'In Progress' but closed, the ticket is disregarded, since the "in progress" time is then not accurate

-- KNOWN EXCEPTIONS / EDGE CASES TO CONSIDER (METHOD 2 & METHOD 3):
-- - Some status changes may not be captured in tblProblemChangeLog
-- - Tickets that were previously resolved but re-entered 'In Progress' may not be flagged accurately - disregarded now as mentioned above
-- - Incoming emails may not originate from the actual customer (e.g., internal escalations or monitoring bots)
-- - A ticket may appear unresolved in tblProblem, but the status change log does not reflect the full state history
-- - Delays based on last action (Method 3) may be skewed by automated or non-customer actions (e.g., internal notes), or 2nd email from customer
-- - Method 2 may miss valid In Progress states if the most recent status update wasnâ€™t captured or synced properly
-- - Method 2: Tickets reassigned between queues may not be reflected unless `AssignedToResourceID` tracking is precise
