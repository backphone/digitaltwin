1. INTRODUCTION
This handbook is a complete guide that explains the features and functions of the XChange system. This
handbook describes how the XChange system works and how it can be set up to meet specific
requirements.
This handbook is designed to be used by IT Administrators and trained Technicians.

1.1 What is XChange?
XChange is a sophisticated network management platform specifically designed for maritime
environments. It seamlessly integrates vessel IT systems with corporate networks, optimizing
bandwidth usage and ensuring secure data transmission.
XChange excels in network integration, allowing onboard IT infrastructure to connect seamlessly with
shore-based corporate networks. This facilitates secure data exchange and remote management,
making it a robust solution for maritime digitalization. The platform optimizes available bandwidth,
ensuring efficient use of satellite connections and maintaining reliable network performance.
It delivers voice, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), data and Internet access in one solution,
independent of the communication technology used: Sealink VSAT, Marlink FX, Mobile Satellite
Services (MSS) such as Inmarsat, Iridium, Low- and Medium Earth Orbit (LEO/MEO) service such as
Starlink, Terrestrial Communication Services like Marlink´s Global 4G and others.
Security is a key focus of XChange, which incorporates advanced measures to protect against cyber
threats and safeguard data integrity. It also offers remote monitoring and management tools, enabling
proactive maintenance and troubleshooting of network devices and systems.
XChange supports a multi-user environment, providing granular control over access permissions and
user roles. This ensures that each user has the appropriate level of access based on their role and
responsibilities, enhancing overall network security and efficiency.
XChange significantly improves crew welfare by providing reliable internet connectivity. This
connectivity allows crew members to stay in touch with family and friends, access entertainment, and
manage personal affairs, thus maintaining morale and well-being during long voyages.
The platform also includes various operational modes, such as VPN management, network VLAN
segregation, and secure data channels. Its centralized dashboard offers a user-friendly interface for
managing network settings, viewing system status, and configuring devices.
In practical terms, XChange ensures secure and efficient data transfer between vessels and corporate
networks, allows continuous monitoring of network performance, and provides robust security
management to protect sensitive information. It also enhances the quality of life for crew members by
providing stable internet access, supporting their mental and emotional well-being.
XChange is an essential tool for managing the complex IT and network demands of modern vessels,
ensuring they remain connected, secure, and supportive of crew welfare.

1.4.1 Safety Instructions
Before handling any equipment, be fully aware of the hazards of working on electrical circuitry.
Ensure that Users are familiar with standard practices for preventing accidents. Please observe
the following safety guidelines when installing or handling the XChange:
•
•
•
•

•
•

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Overloaded outlets, extension cords and power strips can lead to fires or electric shocks
Avoid using socket strips and extension cords if at all possible
Do not connect multiple extension cords or socket strips to each other
Before mounting the XChange on the wall, make sure that there are no electrical lines, gas
or water pipes located where you need to drill the holes. If necessary, check the site with a
pipe detector or consult with qualified experts
Heat accumulation can lead to overheating of the XChange and subsequent damage to the
XChange
Ensure there is adequate air circulation and avoid any risk of tipping over by NOT stacking
or balancing the box on top of other devices. Ensure the installation is firmly and securely
in place
Make sure that the ventilation slits on the XChange housing are always free from
obstruction
Do not cover the XChange
The base of the XChange can heat up during normal operation. This heat can cause
damage to heat-sensitive surfaces
During electrical storms, lightning and electrical surges present a danger to connected
electrical devices
Do not install the XChange during an electrical storm
Moisture and liquids that find their way into the XChange can cause electric shocks or
short circuits
Only use the XChange indoors
Never allow liquids to get inside the XChange
The device contains hazardous components and should only be opened by authorised
Marlink repair Technicians
Do not open the XChange housing
Always disconnect all power supply connections before working on XChange hardware
Check for possible work-area hazards such as damp floors, ungrounded power extension
cables and missing safety grounds
Do not carry out any action that creates a potential hazard to people or renders the
equipment unsafe
Do not work alone if there is any risk of a potentially hazardous condition

WARNING
The chassis of the equipment is tamper proof and should never be opened under
any circumstances. Doing so will void the warranty.

WARNING
Do not work on the device during periods of lightning activity. It is especially
important not to connect or disconnect cables at this time, as the equipment
could act as a conductor.

1.4.2 Handling and Mounting
•

•

•

•
•

•
•
•
•

•

Do not stack or balance the equipment on top of other devices. This prevents problems due to
tripping over cords and cables and allows air to circulate. Check that the installation is fixed
securely in place
Install the box in an open rack whenever possible. If you install it in an enclosed rack, you
should make sure that it has adequate ventilation. Do not add too many devices as each unit
generates heat. An enclosed rack should have louvered sides and a fan to cool the air
When mounting a chassis in an open rack, ensure that the rack frame does not block the intake
or exhaust ports. If the chassis is installed on slides, you should check the position of the
chassis when sliding it all the way into the rack
Ensure you have a properly working UPS system available and connect the XChange to this
UPS. Do not install the system, if no UPS is available or defective
In an enclosed rack that has a ventilation fan on the top, the excess heat generated by
equipment near the bottom of the rack may be drawn upwards into the intake ports of the
equipment above. Make sure you provide adequate ventilation for the equipment at the
bottom of the rack
You can place the XChange on a horizontal surface or mount it on to a wall
Place or hang the XChange in a dry location that is free of dust and protected from direct
sunlight
When connecting the XChange to your on-board network using a network cable, keep in mind
that the cable can be no longer than 100m
If you would like to establish wireless connections between the XChange and a specific area
on board, you should position the XChange WiFi access points at a central location in the target
area
Never pull the power supply if the XChange still runs

WARNING
Failure to comply with the listed safety and operating instructions is a violation of the
general terms and conditions. In such cases, Marlink accepts no liability or warranty and
reserves the right to charge the contractual penalty fee.

3. User Portal and Web Interface
3.1 Navigation Design
The XChange uses ‘L-shaped navigation’ design – the most frequently used navigation design for
‘classic’ web navigation. This involves a combination of horizontal and vertical navigation.
Horizontal navigation is used for main pages such as ‘MY PROFILE’ or the local Intranet. Vertical
navigation is used to navigate down into specific functions inside the main pages or sections.

3.1.1 Top Navigation Bar
The top navigation bar includes the main sections of the XChange. The table below shows which
sections are displayed to each of the 3 User profiles:
ADMINISTRATOR

CAPTAIN

CREW

‘HOME’

√

√

√

‘BOX
SETTINGS’

√

√

‘MY PROFILE’
‘INTRANET’

√

√

√

√

√

The top navigation bar is grey with each section named in white text. When the mouse pointer rolls
over a section, the tab turns orange. When you click on a section or on one of its pages, the section tab
stays orange.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 23/204

3.1.2 Left Navigation Bar
The left navigation bar lists the subsections (2nd level of navigation) and the pages inside the
subsections (3rd level).

3.1.3 Weblets
A 4th level of navigation is possible using horizontal ‘weblets’:

•

Before they are selected, a weblet is coloured white

•

When you select a weblet, the text changes to bold and an orange line appears

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 24/204

3.1.4 Collapsible Panels
To avoid displaying a very large amount of information on a single page, the system uses collapsible
panels to describe a long table or a process.
These panels can be opened or closed independently of each other as shown below:

You can click on each panel and toggle between the expanded and collapsed view. An arrow indicates
the status: pointing to the right (collapsed state) or pointing downwards (expanded state).
3.1.5 Tables
To avoid displaying a very large amount of lines on one page, the system uses flexible tables to display
a large table.
The User can choose what information is displayed.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 25/204

3.1.5.1

Sort the Displayed Information

Click once on the title of a column to sort the list in ascending order and click twice to sort into
descending order.
3.1.5.2

Change the Number of Lines Displayed

The number of lines to be displayed can be changed by clicking on the number on the bottom line of
each table.
Click ‘10’ to display 10 lines per page or ‘100’ to display 100 lines per page. If more lines are available,
then they will be displayed on additional pages.

3.2 General Editing of Data
An example of how to edit the data using the XChange web interface is given below: the example
involves changing the User details for a Crew member. The general method for editing and configuring
values is the same for much of the XChange data.
3.2.1 Information Overview
First, the system provides an overview of the existing data:

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 26/204

3.2.2 Edit Data Values
The data fields being displayed are converted into editable fields.

By clicking on ‘Save’, the data that has been changed is stored in the XChange system and the page is
refreshed.

 You cannot edit fields missing an underline.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 27/204

3.3 Dashboard
When the User successfully logged in, the system automatically redirects them to the ‘HOME’ screen.

The table below shows which information blocks are displayed on the ‘HOME’ page for each User’s
profile.

3.3.1 Connectivity
The connectivity block shows the actual status of each installed communication device.
A red cross indicates an error, either on board (left side) or on the connectivity side (right side). Moving
the mouse pointer above the red cross will display the error message.
All available communication devices that can be used for communication have a green bar below their
name, while any devices that are not available have a red bar below their name. For a better judgement
of connectivity’s quality, a signal strength bar indicates the signal quality for most SatCom connections.
The communication device that is currently in use has an animated light and dark green bar to
represent the communication that is happening.

Clicking the ‘More’ link redirects the Administrator or Captain to the ‘Device Management’ page, giving
access to the device switching overview and the user group – device priority (if Hybrid Switching is
ordered).
3.3.2 Overall Traffic
The ‘Overall Traffic’ block shows the overall traffic consumption for the current day and the current
month. The information is displayed separately for each connected broadband terminal:
•
•
•
•

Name of broadband terminal
Data traffic consumption in volume (MB or Min) and amount (€ or $)
Voice traffic consumption in minutes and amount
VoIP traffic consumption in minutes and amount

Clicking the ‘More’ link redirects the Administrator or Captain to the ‘Traffic Log’ page, providing a
detailed account of changes in traffic over time.

 The ‘Overall Traffic’ block is only displayed for the Administrator and Captain.
 Tip!! Clicking to change the communication type from ‘all’ to either ‘data’, ‘voice’ or ‘voip’ will filter
the display to show only the selected type.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 29/204

3.3.3 Events
The ‘Events’ block displays all event messages if, for example, a device is no longer ready for
connection.
If an alert is issued, then the ‘Type’ (‘Certificate, ‘Connection’, etc.) and the ‘Event’ description will be
displayed inside the box corresponding to the alert category:

Clicking on the ‘More’ link redirects the Administrator or Captain to the ‘Event Log’ page, providing
more details about the events.
To acknowledge and to hide an event message from the dashboard, simply click the ‘X’ next to the
message.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 30/204

3.3.4 Hot Actions
The ‘Hot Actions’ block provides direct access to the most important and commonly used management
functions. With a simple click on one of the ‘Hot Actions’, the User is redirected to the corresponding
subsection within the XChange interface.
If there is an update to the data in one of the ‘Hot Actions’ sections, then the number of new updates is
displayed in an orange cube.

 The ‘Hot Actions’ block contains different actions depending of the User profile.

Captains and Administrators typically have access to the main administration functions within User and
credit management, while the Crew have direct access to the local Intranet and other selected
functions.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 31/204

3.3.5 Latest News and Latest Files
The ‘Latest News’ and ‘Latest Files’ blocks are only displayed on the Crew dashboard. Each time the
local Intranet is updated from shore, the latest and newest updates are shown within these blocks.

The hyperlinked news ‘Title’ forwards the Crew member to the specific news content.

 The updated news or files are only displayed until the User views/reads them. After the first view,
this information is removed from the User’s dashboard to make space for new updates.
3.3.6 Active Users
Only Captains and Administrators have a block on their dashboard called ‘Active Users’ that provides
real-time information about any active User, machine or system account. The ‘Active Users’ section
displays the Users’ name, device used, type of communication and the total usage of the active
communication session.

The small X next to the ‘User’ and the username represents a session cut function for all active
sessions.

Please note
Some system-user may are displayed in the ‘Active User’ section. Because those Users are
mandatory to guarantee a full operational service, their sessions cannot be interrupted.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 32/204

3.3.6.1

Cut an Active Session (Disconnect single Users)

In case the Administrator or Captain wants to make a phone line available or to open the data
bandwidth, it is possible to disconnect single users.
There is an option to prevent reconnection for a defined period to keep the bandwidth available.

The reconnect prevention time is controlled by a slider. The minimum time is 5 minutes and the
maximum reconnect prevention time is 120 minutes. Within this time, disconnected User(s) cannot log
in or make a call.
The disconnect function takes a few seconds to initiate and then the Captain receives the following
message to confirm the disconnection:

The disconnected User either hears a voice prompt on the phone or a notification on the top of his
XChange view informing him that he has been disconnected.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 33/204

3.3.7 My Traffic
The ‘My Traffic’ block shows a User’s personal traffic consumption for the current day and current
month. The information is displayed separately for each connected broadband terminal and type of
service:
•
•
•
•

Name of broadband terminal
Data traffic consumption in amount ($/€) and volume (MB/Min)
Voice traffic consumption in amount ($/€) and volume (MB/Min)
VoIP traffic consumption in amount ($/€) and volume (MB/Min)

 This block is not displayed for an Administrator, as they are not allowed to launch a data session or
voice call,.

 Tip!! Clicking to change the communication type from ‘all’ to either ‘data’, ‘voice’ or ‘voip’ will filter
the display to show only the selected type.
3.3.8 Connection
The ‘Connection’ block enables the Captain and Crew member to launch/disconnect a data session.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 34/204

3.3.8.1

Displayed Information

Before launching a new data session, the ‘Connection’ block displays:
•
•
•
•
•

3.3.8.2

‘Connection’ (available data device)
‘Personal Credit’ (local prepaid User)

3.3.8.3

Disconnect

To disconnect and close the data session, just press the red ‘DISCONNECT’ button.
3.3.8.4 Connect using other Device
Users can change their device to internet access at any time. If the user forgot to disconnect his
previous online-session properly, the XChange offers a forcement to disconnect the previous session.

Please note
On purpose it is not possible to go online with multiple devices in parallel while using 1
user account. To avoid potential side effects, the system forces the user to disconnect
before a new connection can be started.

3.3.8.5

Daily Access Limits

When the User exceeds their allowed time window, or when they have already reached the set
maximum communication duration for that day, the ‘Connection’ block displays a warning message
and the User can no longer connect to the Internet.

3.3.8.6

No Credit

When the User logs into the XChange web interface but does not have enough prepaid credit left, the
system displays the following message instead of the connection controller:

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 36/204

3.4 Notifications
The XChange will occasionally notify the User of important notifications. These notifications are eventdriven and are mainly to inform the Captain.

The notifications will be displayed each time the User logs in until the notifications are all resolved.
Some notifications are only to provide information, such as ‘The Price Matrix has been updated’, while
others can forward the Captain directly to the correct subsection of the XChange interface, for example
to the ‘Credit Management’ page. Appendix E lists all available notifications.
3.4.1.1 Important Notifications with Actions
For very important events, such like for instance system clock update, security patch deployment or
others, the system plans a specific reboot time afront. If the Captain does not react, the system will
reboot automatically at the planned & displayed time UTC.
The system plans automatically with a waiting period of 48 hours, since the event happened. E.g. the
Captain influence the reboot time by either clicking on “Reboot Now” or reboot in the given options.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

3.5 My Profile
The ‘MY PROFILE’ section is displayed for both the Captain and Users.
‘MY PROFILE’ provides individual account management and personalisation capabilities to access:
•

•
•
•

User account details
o Password / PIN code management
o Credit management
o Personal account management
Usage log
Permissions
Check telephony costs

3.5.1 Account
The ‘Account’ section gives an overview of the User’s account details.
3.5.1.1

Corporate vs. Personal Credit

The XChange works with 2 separate credit accounts, called ‘Credit Baskets’.
The corporate credit basket is typically refilled manually by the responsible personnel or filled
automatically via the ‘Automatic Credit Renewal’ function. The corporate credit can only be spent by
the User for online data sessions, while voice communication is prohibited.
The personal credit basket can be filled manually by the responsible personnel, reloaded via XChange
embedded prepaid vouchers or by a User’s individual credit requests. Personal credit can be used for
any kind of communication, including voice communication. For data connections, the system will, by
default, first try to spend the corporate credit and will only use the personal credit if there is no
corporate credit remaining.

The ‘Credits’ tab is where you can manage XChange local prepaid functions. This tab provides the
latest information on remaining corporate and personal credit and when the next automatic credit top
up of the corporate credit is planned. You can top up your credit by either using a previously purchased
prepaid voucher or by requesting new credit directly.
3.5.1.2.1 Credit Top-Up via Prepaid Voucher
To top up your personal credit with prepaid vouchers, a valid prepaid voucher must be purchased by
the responsible personnel on board, such as the Captain.
Prepaid voucher codes always consist of 12 characters.
After purchasing a voucher, access the XChange interface and log in with your personal account
details.
Go to “MY PROFILE” and type the voucher code in the ‘Voucher number’ field:

Once the credit refill is successful, a notification is shown in green and the ‘Personal credit’ value is
topped up with the amount of credit that was linked to that voucher:

If there is an error during refill, for example, if the voucher code has already been used, is blocked, or
not does not exist, then the corresponding error message is displayed above the refill function.
3.5.1.2.2 Credit Top-Up via Credit Request
In case the ‘Credit Request’ function is activated, it is possible to request credit top-up directly through
the “MY PROFILE” page, without the need to ask the Administrator on board.
Top-up requests of between 10 and 50 $/€ can be made by using the slider.
A monthly order limit can also be set and displayed on the interface, as well as the remaining amount
that can be ordered before the monthly limit is reached.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 39/204

To request new credit, simply drag the slider to the correct amount to be requested.
If the new request is still within the monthly order limit, the credit top-up will be processed
immediately.
If the new request exceeds the monthly order limit, a warning message is shown:

If the button ‘WAIT FOR APPROVAL’ is pressed, the credit request is stored and transmitted to the
responsible personnel to decide.
For example, the Captain will receive this credit request and can accept or decline the request.
The ‘Request History’ table, shown below the credit request, provides tracking information for each
credit request. The ‘Status’ column indicates if a pending credit request was accepted or declined.

PLEASE NOTE
The credit request function may not be available. The decision for this is taken by the
responsible Administrator or Fleet Management on shore.
3.5.1.2.3 Credit Top-Up while online
When credit top-ups are requested, or prepaid voucher loaded, during an active voice call or data
session, the system will not issue that credit top-up immediately.
Once the voice call or data session ends, the credit top-up will be executed immediately.

4. Devices (Connectivity)
4.1 Terminals (WAN)
Please only connect broadband terminals to the WAN (Wide Area Network) RJ-45 sockets of the
XChange.
Please review Appendix B for a detailed list of controlled and supported connectivity services.

WARNING
Do not connect devices such as computers or network routers between the broadband
terminals and the XChange. Any device which is connected to the terminal directly
cannot be controlled and managed by XChange.
Marlink will not accept any claims for high traffic consumption if, for example, a device
bypasses the XChange.

Please note
You will find a dedicated setup procedure for Furuno Felcom and JRC JUE FleetBroadband
terminals in the Appendix section at the end of this document.
4.1.1 Broadband Device Prerequisites
Ensure that the broadband devices listed below are configured as indicated:
Controlled broadband devices (MSS)
FleetBroadband:
• The LAN port connected to the XChange is enabled
• Router mode is enabled
• Profile ‘automatic activation’ is disabled
• PPPoE is enabled
• The analogue voice port is set to 5.4 Hz only
• The IP handset is set to static IP mode using, for example, 192.168.0.20
(IP range 192.168.0.1 to 192.168.0.19 are reserved for XChange)
Iridium Certus:
• The LAN port connected to the XChange is enabled
• The SIM card is on ‘postpaid’ mode and not ‘prepaid’
• SIP accounts are created and set to proper lines
• Wifi is disabled

Autonomous broadband devices
•
•
•

The LAN port connected to the XChange is enabled
The DHCP service is either enabled or disabled depending on the WAN port settings during the XChange
wizard initialisation process
The autonomous terminal has the profile ‘automatic activation’ enabled to connect to the Internet
automatically once within coverage

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 55/204

4.1.2 Controlled vs Autonomous Devices
Only broadband terminals with Marlink airtime are deemed to be ‘controlled’ devices.
XChange can ‘control’ the online status of controllable devices and to make use of the voice service (if
available). The XChange turns the controllable device ‘online’ only when this is required to establish a
data connection and it returns the device ‘offline’ again if there is no online connection required. This
automatic action ensures cost-optimal usage while avoiding unnecessary traffic consumption,
especially on typical MSS devices with smaller allowance plans.
The same applies for voice calls. The XChange only supports the voice service which comes with the
satellite device if that device is deemed to be a controlled device using Marlink airtime.
Autonomous devices are deemed to be ‘supported’ by XChange. XChange does not handle those
terminals the same way as controlled devices. If an autonomous device offers voice service, then
sometimes, due to non-Marlink airtime being used, or if the autonomous device uses another
technology that prevents XChange from taking control, then it cannot be used through the XChange but
can only be used with phone equipment directly connected to the device.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 56/204

4.2 Devices Overview & Switching
To access the connections overview, go to: BOX SETTINGS > Devices > Devices.
The overview page provides information about all broadband terminal connections set up during the
initialisation wizard process.

The ‘Overview’ provides information about the status of each broadband terminal.
A red cross indicates an error either on board (left side) or on the connectivity side (right side). Moving
the mouse pointer above the red cross will display the error message.
All available communication devices that can be used for communication have a green bar below their
names. Devices that are not available have a red bar below their name.
The communication device currently in use has a moving bar with light and dark green to show that
communication is possible. Above the moving bar on the right side, icons show which type of
communication is happening, for example ‘Data’ and/or ‘Voice traffic’.
On the device overview all available user groups are shown. If many user groups are created, the list is
extended. Above the user group overview, a search option simplifies finding the group in question.
Devices being ready to use, are shown in green followed by a green Globe-icon. This Globe-icon
flashes if at least 1 user of a group is online via that device.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 57/204

4.3 Multiple Device Routing
If your XChange is setup with Auto-Switch / SD-WAN Lite (aka Hybrid connectivity), the overview page
provides the status which user group has which unique terminal ranking defined.
Only in this switching mode, the use of all online devices at the same time is possible.

Based on the global device ranking, which is defined during installation, per default all user groups
follow this general device ranking.
Only with SD-WAN Lite connectivity the device ranking can be re-defined at any time for each user
group individually.
To change the default device ranking for a user group, click the
icon. The page refreshes and shows
the communication channel assignment page for that user group.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

Within ‘Connectivity Test’ (click to expand), you can view the activation status of the connectivity test,
its detailed settings and the current status.
The ‘Current Status’ shows the amount of consecutively sent pings since the last status change. Once a
terminal changes from ‘online’ to ‘offline’, the counter is reset to 0 (zero).
While the connectivity test is happening, the ping counter counts each successful ping until the defined
threshold is met. Once the threshold is met, the device is indicated as online again.
Within ‘Communication Channels’ (click to expand), you can view status information about each
channel that has been set up. Activation and connection status are displayed separately for each
communication channel.
Within ‘Active Users’ (click to expand), you can see all users communicating through that device at the
moment you´re watching.

 The number of communication channels displayed varies according to the broadband terminal and
the individual setup.

4.5 Manual Device Switching
The XChange makes it possible to switch manually from one terminal to another. The Captain or
Administrator can activate or deactivate one of the configured broadband devices. All data, voice and
VoIP communications are carried out for the activated device.
While switching off the device, all traffic to the device will be blocked and, for controlled devices, all
online connections will be terminated at the same time.
4.5.1 Activate a Terminal
To activate a terminal, go to BOX SETTINGS > Devices and click once on the ‘On/Off’ button next to the
name of the device as shown below.

Confirm in the pop-up window that this terminal should be activated. The previously grey bars on the
left and right side turn dark green and once a User or automatic system starts to communicate with the
Internet, the bars start to move in light and dark green again.
If the XChange is set to “Manual Switch” as the only switching method, the previously activated
terminal, will be automatically deactivated after confirmation and the active data and voice session will
be disconnected without sending a warning message to the User who is connected.
4.5.2 Deactivate a Terminal
To deactivate a terminal, follow the same process described above.
All active data and VoIP sessions will be disconnected immediately, and, for controlled devices, all
active IP sessions will be terminated.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

4.6 Semi-Automatic Device Switching (VSAT Fall-Back)
The XChange allows semi-automatic device switching from the backup to the default device. The semiautomatic device switch is preconfigured by Marlink and needs no additional manual action.
The manual device switch for Captain and Administrator remains available with a limited time of use.
In case the default device goes offline, the Captain has to switch on the backup device to continue
communications.
The XChange periodically checks the availability and stability of the default device in the background.
When the default connection is ready and stabilised again, the connection will be switched
automatically back to the default device.

Please note
If a backup device is manually enabled, then although the main device is considered as
‘online’, the maximum use time should be limited avoiding unnecessary use of the backup.
4.6.1 Determine a Default Device
To check the default device, go to: BOX SETTINGS > Devices > Device Ranking.

The overview shows which communication device is the default device for data and voice separately.
The priority may differ for data and voice communication.

Please note
Only Marlink can determine the default device. Marlink’s Sealink VSAT is the default main
device in most cases.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 64/204

4.6.2 Backup Device Timeout
For the semi-automatic and fully automatic device switching options, an automatic backup device
timeout is predefined by Marlink.

To check the maximum timeout, in minutes, please check the ‘Full Automatic Switching’ or ‘SemiAutomatic Switching’ panel below the device priority.
The default maximum timeout is set to 30 minutes. This setting can only be changed by Marlink super
Administrators if an exception is part of the contract.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 65/204

4.6.3 Automatic Device Switching / SD-WAN Lite
To see the automatic device switching settings, go to BOX SETTINGS > Devices > Device Ranking.

The general device switching settings can be checked here. The switching can be either enabled or
disabled. If this feature is set on disabled, then automatic device switching will not be available.
The session cut delay (in seconds) is preset to 15 seconds. When the default device is online and
stabilised again, the system will wait 15 seconds before cutting active sessions during device
switching.

Please note
Only Marlink can change the activation status for the device switching.

Please note
Automatic device switching is performed only on change of default device status. If device
switching is performed manually while the default device is online, the system will not
switch back to the default device after the timeout function counts to 0 (zero).

By default, the disconnection is disabled. This means that this communication channel is always
available for that device whether it is used or not.
‘Disconnection’ can be set to ‘Auto-Disconnect’ which will create a new line asking how many seconds
this link should be kept open for before it is disconnected. Once the last User or system stops using a
link with enabled auto-disconnection, the counter starts to count up to the set number of seconds. If
no User or system requires this channel for data communication within this time, then it will be
disconnected automatically.
Allocation mode
The IP allocation mode is normally defined by the Installer through the installation wizard, but the IP
allocation mode and IP details can be changed here if they need to be adjusted.
Once the settings have been changed, click ‘Save’ to store the changes.

Communication Channel Diagnostics

In case one or more communication channels on Sealink VSAT do not work correctly, for example, if
the Crew cannot access the Internet through the ‘Crew Channel’, then supporting personnel can
diagnose each communication channel separately.
The diagnosis shows whether communication through this specific channel is possible or not. The test
itself uses standard pings and DNS resolution to validate the channel availability.
To start the diagnosis, simply select a channel and click ‘DIAGNOSE’ below the list:

A new pop-up window appears, giving real-time information about the connectivity status of the tested
communication channel:

Please note
This channel diagnostic is not counted by XChange traffic logs, but still uses a small
amount of data and bandwidth. Therefore, Marlink recommends that the diagnostics are
only used for troubleshooting on request. This diagnostic cannot be proceeded remotely.

4.7.5.2

XChange URA Retry Mechanism

The XChange ‘Universal Remote Access’ (URA) channel tries automatically to connect to the shore
servers. In some cases, the ‘URA channel’ may not be able to connect to the servers. To prevent the
automatic retry mechanism from consuming a large amount of data traffic while retrying every few
seconds, an incremental retry timer is enabled.
The default retry period for the XChange URA service is 30 seconds. If, after 3 attempts, the
connection cannot be established, then the timer adds another 13 seconds to the delay for the next
attempt. The increment timer adds another 13 seconds to the waiting period for each new attempt,
until the preset maximum of 500 seconds between 2 connection attempts is reached.

This diagram visualises the subsequent retry delays over time:

This incremental retry mechanism can be enabled for other communication channels if desired. To
enable the incremental retry mechanism, ‘Edit’ the communication channel.

4.7.5.3

Create a New Communication Channel

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 74/204

In random cases and a more specialised setups, it is may required to create additional communication
channel. Typically only required, if extra Links were created before, or if the XChange Interconnect
service is ordered. To create a new communication channel:
Go to the device
Expand the ‘Communication Channels’ panel
Click ‘New’
Define a channel name (no spaces or special characters)
Define a description (this will appear on User home pages)

4.7.6 VPN
The embedded VPN client supports connection to shore-based ‘Open VPN’ and ‘GRE VPN’ servers. The
VPN client can be enabled and set up for any communication channel and broadband terminal
individually.
This provides fully flexible configuration capabilities. It is possible to link the whole vessel data
communication to the onshore VPN server, or just one User group such as machines or corporate
traffic.
The VPN channel can be defined as one-way (XChange > shore) or two-way (XChange <> shore)
communication.
The two-way option provides remote access to on-board network clients linked to the VPN channel.

4.7.7 Adapt Voice Line Numbers
If there is an incorrect number entered during the installation wizard, only the superadmin can change
the phone numbers for each voice line without the need to restart the installation wizard.

To change the voice line numbers, expand the panel ‘XChange Voice Lines’ and click ‘Edit’:

The line name and line number can be changed. Once the changes are entered, click ‘SAVE’ to store
the changes. Please note that no additional voice line can be added here: to add or remove voice lines
you need to restart the installation wizard.

Please note
The voice line adjustment works for all devices that provide voice services. This function is
very useful during fleet-wide roll-out projects. If an XChange is configured with a backup
file created on another XChange, then the individual device details can be changed without
the need to restart the wizard.

4.7.8 Firewall
For each terminal connected, the Administrator can apply a different set of firewall filtering rules.

Firewall filtering settings at the terminal level are the 1st stage of the XChange’s integrated Firewall.
At this stage, you can set a first level of pre-filtering to allow traffic that should usually go through the
terminal. This will block any type of traffic and ports not covered by a special firewall filter.
By default, there is no special firewall filtering and any kind of traffic is allowed through. It is
recommended that you change the default setup and define the specific types of traffic to be allowed.

4.7.9 Device Access
The broadband ‘Device Access’ dashboard enables device access to be opened or closed individually
for each device. Opening device access allows the Administrator to access e.g. the terminal modem
dashboard via any local network computer connected to the XChange local network.

To enable the device access simply expand the ‘Device Access’ collapsible panel and click ‘Open
device access’.

 Only the Administrator can access the device dashboard.

4.7.10

Connectivity Test

For all communication devices, a ‘Connectivity Tester’ automatically tests the online status.
The XChange tests the online connectivity periodically by pinging a defined onshore server. If the
device is online, then this test will be performed every 10 seconds. If the set threshold of failed pings is
reached, then the XChange defines the connection as offline and raises an alert on the Captain’s
dashboard.
For a device with status offline, the connectivity test will be performed every 10 seconds. When the set
threshold of successful pings is reached, then the XChange recognises the connection as online and
stabilises again.

The test settings can be changed by the Administrator by clicking on ‘Edit’.
The remote IP address which should be pinged can be changed or the function itself can be switched
off. The ‘Status’ counts all previous connectivity test pings and the number of unsuccessful pings.

WARNING
Marlink does not recommend the use of the ‘Block All’ firewall filter at the device level.
As mandatory firewalling, in case no other communication should be available on the
backup device please allow XChange required data traffic on shore-based firewalls as
well to avoid that the connectivity tester is blocked.
If it is blocked, a huge number of pings can cause a high data traffic consumption.
4.7.10.1 Connectivity Test on Iridium
On Iridium devices, the connectivity test is setup differently. For Iridium devices, the tester checks if a
valid connection between the XChange and the device is established. It does not test the data
connection status.

A warning message displayed with the yellow icon says: “Ready to use, if Iridium network is available”

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 82/204

4.7.10.2 Edit the connectivity tester
By clicking on ‘Edit’, it´s possible to change the connectivity tester parameter or to disable it
completely.
If a faster online-status change is preferred, the number of pings can be reduced to 1.
If a more reliable online-status change is preferred, the number of can be increased to 20.

WARNING
Marlink does not recommend the use very low numbers of pings. If the amount of pings
is to small, the online status of a device may changes very often which can turn into an
inconvenient situation.
Each time the XChange changes the connection, all communication going through the
‘offline’ device will be cut to reinitialise the communication on the next terminal.

5. User Account Management
The integrated User Account Management provides management capabilities for a single User or a
User group. It enables the Captain and Administrator to manage User credits (local prepaid), User
group firewalling, and general access restrictions for specific User groups. A real-time cost control and
monitoring are other important management capabilities that are provided.

5.1 Overview
The ‘Accounts’ ‘Overview’ page provides a summary overview of active user connections.

The table displays all active user accounts and gives additional information about each connection:
•
•
•
•
•

5.2 Manage User Groups
To access the User group management feature, go to: BOX SETTINGS > Accounts > Groups.
With group management, you can create, manage and delete User groups. It is mandatory to work with
User groups in XChange. Every single User must be linked to a specific User group, as User
management is based on managing groups. By reducing the management effort to a minimum, the
system becomes more user-friendly and at the same time ensures there are no ‘uncontrolled’ Users.

The overview of groups provides general information about all User groups that have been defined,
including:
•
•
•
•
•

Group name
Group description
Group type
Accounting mode
Assigned type of connectivity per group

5.2.1 Group Types
The group type defines the kind of access, communication rights and authentication modes that will be
provided for single Users linked to a group. In the XChange, predefined group types are as follows:
Master
The master type provides read and partial write access to the XChange system. Users linked to a
master group can view XChange settings, manage Users and User groups, and carry out manual
terminal switching.
User
XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 86/204

The User type provides read-only access to the XChange portal. The XChange settings and support
page is hidden and cannot be accessed. The User type is the default setting for Crew member groups.
Users linked to a User group can see the XChange portal and can launch data or voice sessions
(depending on the associated terminal connectivity).
Machine
The machine type is preset for a group of on-board network components and systems that
communicate through the satellite link with host systems on shore. As these on-board systems cannot
authenticate themselves, all the systems linked to the machine group do not need to authenticate
before communicating through the associated connectivity.
Admin
The Admin type provides full read and write access to the XChange system. The Administrator can
make changes to XChange settings but is not allowed to launch data or voice sessions.
Please contact Marlink Service Desk if additional administrative accounts should be created.
5.2.2 Payment Modes
Three payment modes are provided with the XChange:
•
•

Corporate usage
Local allowance

Corporate usage
The corporate usage mode is predefined for corporate postpaid communication. Typically, machines
and the Captain can make corporate postpaid communications.

Local allowance
Linking a user group with the local allowance mode enables on-board User credit management without
the need to use prepaid cards such as the Universal Card service.
Users linked to a local prepaid group need to have positive credit to be able to launch data or voice
sessions.

5.2.3.9

Set Up Daily Access Limits

You can apply daily access limits to data and voice communications individually for each User group.
The system will allow communication only either within the set time windows (based on the on-board
set time) and/or until the set maximum duration has been reached. If a User tries to communicate
outside of the set time windows or the maximum duration is already reached, then the system will
decline the request and inform the User accordingly. For all members of a User group, the same
settings will take effect regardless of when the User account was created.

The ‘Daily Access Limits’ offer 3 different modes:
1. ‘Disabled’
a. No access limitations
2. ‘Maximum Daily Duration’
a. A maximum number of hours per day for communication
3. ‘Daily Time Windows’
a. Communication is allowed within the time windows specified (up to 3 windows)

To set a daily access limit for a group, click the ‘Daily Access Limits’ collapsible panel to expand it, and

5.2.3.10 Set Up Automatic Credit Reloads
To ease the management of local prepaid credit, automatic credit reloads can be applied to any ‘Local
Allowance’ User group. When set up, the XChange will reload the credits of all Users belonging to that
User group automatically, as defined during the configuration of this function.

Please note
Credits provided automatically by the XChange can only be used for data communication.
This special credit is named ‘Corporate Credit’. Because telephony always carries a realcost component, local allowance Users need to purchase ‘Personal Credits’ before
telephony will be possible.
The automatic credit reload offers 2 different modes. Either a regular credit top-up can be defined,
which adds the set top-up amount to any remaining corporate credit up to a defined maximum, or
regular reset can be defined, which will reset the corporate credit to a set amount. Any remaining
credit extra credit will be lost for the User.
The regular reload cycles can be set to:
-

Daily
Weekly
Monthly

Automatic Credit Reset

To set a regular credit reset, click on ‘RESET’ and select the reload cycle, such as daily, weekly or
monthly.

Manage Self-Created Users

Once a new self-created User account is available, the Captain will be notified on his dashboard
immediately after login.

allowance User group.
The available User group functions are:
-

Restrict network access
Manage granted connectivity
User group firewall
Daily access limits

Please note
The automatic credit reloads and credit self-order functions are not available to this User
group to avoid misuse of a potentially ‘free’ allowance by Crew. A standard User group is
required to use these functions.

6. Credit Management
All local allowance (aka local prepaid) administration tasks are centralised in a focused menu.
There are several ways to access credit management. One of the ‘Hot Actions’ on the dashboard can
be clicked, redirecting to the specific sub-page of the credit management functions:

Or, simply go to BOX SETTINGS > Credits to access the credit management overview:

The credits overview contains the most common credit administration tasks such as providing an
overview of actual credit for each local allowance User, individual credit management, pending credit
requests and pending credit updates.
Currencies:
XChange supports 3 different currencies. €=Euro, $= Dollar, U=Units. Depending on the preferred
currency selected during installation, one of the currencies will be used across the installation.

6.1 Corporate vs Personal credit
The XChange works with 2 separate credit accounts, called ‘Credit Baskets’.
The corporate credit basket is typically refilled manually by the responsible personnel or filled
automatically via the ‘Automatic Credit Renewal’ function. The corporate credit can only be spent by
the User for online data sessions, while voice communication is prohibited.
The personal credit basket can be filled manually by the responsible personnel, reloaded via XChange
embedded prepaid vouchers or by a User’s individual credit requests. Personal credit can be used for
any kind of communication, including voice communication. For data connections, the system will, by
default, first try to spend the corporate credit and will only use the personal credit if there is no
corporate credit remaining.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 112/204

6.2 Individual Credit Management
To manage a User’s local credit, select the specific username(s) in question. There are 3 ways of
changing a User’s credit:
•
•
•

Top-up
Reset

credit baskets. Click on ‘DONE’ to refresh the page and display the updated current credit.

Reset
To reset the credit, click the ‘Credit Reset’ button, select the credit basket to be reset and set the credit
amount to which the credit should be reset to. Click on ‘DONE’ to refresh the page and display the
updated current credit.

 Reset the User’s credits will set the credit basket to the set amount. Any credits remaining before
the reset will be lost/overwritten, i.e. the reset does not add to the existing amount of credit, it replaces
it with a new amount.
Remove
To subtract an amount from the User’s credit, click the ‘Credit Remove’ button, select the credit basket
to be reset and set the credit amount to be removed. Click on ‘DONE’ to refresh the page and display
the updated current credit.

© Marlink ● Page 113/204

6.3 Manage Credit Requests
If the credit self-ordering function is enabled, then a local allowance User will be able to request credit
top-ups without the need to request any action from the Administrator. If the credit order limit is
reached, or the option to ‘validate each order’ is enabled, then each request will be displayed in the
‘Credit Request’ table.

The table shows the real name of the User, User ID, User group, the total ordered amount within the
actual month and the amount of the latest order. If the User has exceeded the monthly order limit,
then a warning icon will indicate this.
Any credit request can be either approved or rejected. To do so, select the specific request and click
either the ‘Approve’ or the ‘Reject’ button.

Once any credit request is approved, the respective credit log entry is created by XChange
automatically and the User’s credit is updated.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 114/204

6.3.1 Credit Request Configuration
To configure or disable the credit request function, go to BOX SETTINGS > Credits > Settings:

Activation
By default, the credit request function is enabled and can be simply disabled with a click on the green
‘On’ button.
Configuration
The default configuration is set to NOT await an approval for each credit request. Approval will only be
requested if the monthly order limit for a local allowance User group is reached.
Enabling ‘Validate every order’ will ignore any monthly order limit set for a User group. To enable the
validation, click the tick-box and click ‘Save’ to store the settings.
Request storage
The request storage period (in days) is set to 30 days. The period can be changed between 0 and 90
days for how long requests are stored in the database.

6.4 Credit Updates while user online
Whatever credit update option is used, all credits are changed immediately.
If the user is online, during credit change the system will store the credit update and execute it as soon
as the user goes offline. Once the user went offline, the system will automatically apply any credit
change.
After a credit update is stored, the system informs immediately about the online user:

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

6.5 Prepaid Voucher Management
The embedded prepaid voucher mechanism enables the sale of prepaid PIN vouchers to any local
allowance User. The Administrator can freely decide the amount of credit to be available per voucher.
A combination of vouchers with different credit amounts can be used at the same time.
Prepaid voucher can be bought by a local allowance User. The User can use that voucher code to top
up their personal credit basket by accessing the ‘My Profile’. Once the User has topped up their
personal credit, the used voucher code status will be set to ‘used’ and it cannot be reused.

Please note
Prepaid vouchers cannot be used for online or voice access. A valid User account is strictly
mandatory.

The overview page shows a table with all created vouchers, containing the status, batch name, unique
voucher number and the assigned credit amount.
6.5.1 Create New Vouchers
To create a new batch of vouchers, go to BOX SETTINGS > Credits > Prepaid Vouchers:
Expand the ‘Create new vouchers’ panel and set the number of new vouchers to be created and the

batch can be deleted to free up space on the voucher overview.
Before a voucher batch can be deleted, it needs to be deactivated.
Expand the ‘Voucher codes’ panel and click the closed-lock icon to the left of a specific voucher batch
to deactivate it.

The page refreshes and displays the deactivated voucher batch written in light grey.
To reactivate a voucher batch, click the ‘Open Lock’ icon in to the left of the voucher batch.
To delete a voucher batch, click the ‘Bin’ icon. A confirmation pop-up will appear asking for
confirmation.

9. Network
The XChange acts as a network router that manages all connected broadband terminals and the onboard local networks. One of its key features is an embedded multi-network management optionally
splitting into several physical networks or trunking multiple networks into 1 physical port.
Sophisticated features such as Firewall filter management, remote access and many more can be
accessed & managed in the Network section.

9.1 Network Connection
First, connect all network devices such as computers and switches to the LAN ports of the XChange using
RJ-45 cables.
•
•
•

LAN port 1 is pre-set for connecting to the bridge/operation network
LAN port 2 is pre-set for connecting to the Crew network
‘ETH’ ports 5–8 are optional network ports available on XChange Power only

WARNING
Never connect devices such as computers or network routers, directly to the broadband
terminal. Such computers would not form part of the managed network of the XChange
and so cannot use its features!
9.1.1

Local Network Extensions

All local networks can be extended to connect multiple network devices together into a single shared
network. To extend the corporate or crew network, you can use Ethernet switches and/or a WiFi access
point.
As only 1 IP range and only 1 DHCP server can act in one network, ensure that you disable the DHCP
service on all connected switches and routers to avoid any IP addressing conflicts.

9.1.2

Network Management Modes

The XChange support all three network management modes in interface assignments.
Access Mode: This mode is used for end devices such as computers, printers, and IP phones. Each port
in Access mode can be assigned to only one network with or without VLAN-ID and typically connects to
a single device or a LAN. It ensures that traffic from the device/LAN is carried only within its designated
network.
Trunk Mode: Trunk mode is used to carry traffic for multiple VLANs between switches or network
devices. It allows a single port to handle traffic from multiple VLANs by tagging with the appropriate
VLAN-ID. This mode is essential for inter-switch links and maintaining VLAN continuity across the
network.
Hybrid Mode: Hybrid mode combines the characteristics of both Access and Trunk modes. It allows a
port to manage traffic for multiple VLANs in Trunk mode, but also supports untagged traffic for a native
network, similar to Access mode. This flexibility makes Hybrid mode suitable for complex network
setups requiring versatile VLAN handling.

9.2 Local Area Networks (vLANs/LANs)
XChange efficiently manages physical networks and VLANs, ensuring seamless connectivity and
optimal performance. It provides robust tools for configuring, monitoring, and securing network
infrastructures. To manage the network parameters, go to: BOX SETTINGS > Network > LANs/WANs.

WARNING
Only IT specialists familiar with virtual networks and network management should change
the networking section of XChange.

WARNING when using VLANs
Make sure connected networking peripherals such as Switches and WiFi Access Points are
configured accordingly to the XChange networks and interfaces to ensure accessible
networks. Any missing or wrong configuration in connected network peripherals may
cause an inaccessibility of the XChange.
Never delete all networks at once. Before rebooting to apply network changes and
interface assignments, ensure at least 1 interface has at least 1 valid network assigned.

Please note
Changes in network settings or interface assignments take effect only after a reboot.

9.2.1

Interfaces

The Interfaces page is different between an XChange Base and XChange Power hardware due to the
different amount of network interfaces.

The ‘LANs/WANs’ menu provides an easy overview of interfaces, assigned networks or WAN devices
per interface. While interfaces can be defined and changed at any time for local networks, all interfaces
connected to WAN devices provide an informative read-only.
The ‘Interfaces’ overview provides the following details for each physical port:
•
•
•
•
•
9.2.2

The name of the physical port as printed on the hardware
The MAC address of each physical port
The networking interface mode
Assigned access network (if any) or communication device (if any)
Assigned trunk members (if any) or communication devices (if any
Interface Configuration

Any previously created network can be assigned to any interface. Assignments can also be changed at
any time.
To assign networks to an interface, click on the interface:

Unused interfaces are disabled by default. Select ‘LAN’ to enable the interface

Any network can be configured as Access Network. Optionally stored VLAN-IDs are ignored.
Select the network which should be the assigned access network on that interface and click ‘Save’.

 Only 1 network can be assigned as access network to an interface.
 Tip!! XChange supports to have the same network assigned on multiple interfaces in access mode.
9.2.2.2 Configuration in Trunk Mode
Any network with a valid VLAN-ID can be configured as Trunk Member. Any number of networks can be
assigned as a trunk member.
Set the interface mode to ‘Trunk’ and select the networks which should be members of the network
trunk on that interface and click ‘Save’.

 Only networks with valid VLAN-IDs can be assigned as trunk members to an interface. Networks
without a VLAN-ID (Access) cannot be selected.

 Tip!! XChange supports to have the same network assigned on multiple interfaces in trunk mode.

9.2.2.3 Configuration in Hybrid Mode
In Hybrid Mode its is possible to assign mixed networks to one interface. 1 network can be assigned as
Access Network plus any number of networks can be assigned as trunk member.
Set the interface mode to ‘Hybrid’ and select the network which should be the access network and the
networks which should be the members of the network trunk on that interface.

 Any network, with or without VLAN-ID can be assigned as access network. Trunk member must
have a valid VLAN-ID.

 Tip!! XChange supports to have the same network assigned as Access and Trunk member at the
same time.

VLAN ID:
A VLAN-ID is optional and only required if the network should be used as trunk member. If no VLANs
are used on board, it is possible to create LANs without VLAN-ID.
LAN details
It is possible to change the IP address mode from ‘Static’ to ‘DHCP Server’ and to set the XChange’s
local IP address according to the IP address range within that network.
DHCP server IP Address-Range
If DHCP is enabled, the embedded DHCP service requires a valid IP Address-range within the same IP
Address-range like the XChange IP Address.

Please note
VLAN-IDs and IP Address ranges must be unique per network. It is not possible to create
multiple LANs with the same VLAN-ID or same IP Address range.
After creation the new network will be listed in the LANs overview.

The icon behind the name shows that this network is ready to be created during reboot of XChange.

9.2.3.2 MAC–IP Address Combinations
If the DHCP service is enabled in one network, then the XChange provides a MAC–IP address
association.
The MAC–IP addressing combination is used in dynamically managed networks to lock an IP address
to a specific MAC address of a network client. This means that this network client receives the same
local IP address every time it connects to the network.
While creating a new LAN, any planned MAC/IP combination can be set immediately.

Combining a MAC to an IP address after network creation
To make a combination on a:
•

9.4 Open LAN
A whole LAN can be defined as ‘Open LAN’, which disables the per default required user
authentication. Any computer/user connected to an Open LAN has immediate internet access. To
ensure highest security and access control, all control mechanisms normally available within usergroup management are available for Open LANs including assignment of communication devices,
Sealink data priorities, Firewall, DNS whitelisting and daily access restrictions.

Please note
Activating a Local Network as ‘OpenLAN’ will bypass the user authentication and the
embedded local prepaid system.
Users connected to an Open LAN can still access the XChange interface but not connect to
the internet with their personal account.

To define a local network as ‘Open LAN’ click the ‘Edit’ button. You are redirected to a new page where
the status can be changed to ‘On’.
To define a LAN as ‘Open LAN’ go to Box Settings > Network > Open LAN.

Select a network from the drop-down menu and activate the status.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

9.6 Firewall Filter Management
To manage firewall filters, go to: BOX SETTINGS > Network > Firewall.
The firewall page inside the ‘Network’ subsection represents the core of the embedded firewall feature
of the XChange. On this page, the Administrator can create, edit or delete firewall filters.

The embedded firewall is created to support the Administrator with optimal filter management
resources.
The firewall filters that are managed here are allocated to User groups and to broadband terminals
connected to the system.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 149/204

9.6.1 Predefined Firewall Filter
The XChange provides a full set of predefined firewall filters covering the most popular types of traffic
and requirements.
Predefined filters are a preconfigured set of rules that contain combinations of the most common IP
protocols and services used for satellite communications. They ensure that only specific applications or
protocols are allowed to pass through the XChange (also known as whitelisting).
The predefined filters are:

DESCRIPTION
‘BLOCK ALL’

Blocks any type of data traffic

CYBERGUARD EDR

Allows EDR update communication
Allows FTP traffic.

‘FTP ACTIVE MODE’

 Software must be set to ‘active
mode’
Any traffic is allowed.

‘OPEN’

 This filter is preselected for all
new terminals and User groups!

‘POP AND IMAP EMAIL’

Allows POP and IMAP email
communication

‘SKYFILE MAIL’

Allows SkyFile Mail traffic

‘WEB’

Allows web (Internet) access
(HTTP and HTTPS)

Please note
The device firewall offers more predefined filters which are NOT shown in the firewall
management page. Marlink prohibits access to these filters to avoid accidently changing
system-critical filters such as XChange System traffic.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 150/204

9.6.2 Create a Firewall Filter
In addition to the predefined firewall filter, the Administrator can create a personal firewall filter to
meet specific firewalling requirements.
To create a personal firewall filter:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Go to BOX SETTINGS > Network > Firewall
Click ‘New’
Type in a filter name and description
Click ‘Add’
Select ‘Easy’ or ‘Expert’
Click ‘Save’
Repeat steps 3–5 to add more rules
Set the rule sequence (if more than 1 rule is applied)
Click ‘Save’ to save the settings

ports.

To create a rule in expert mode:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Select the action
Select the direction
Select a protocol
Set the designated IP address and subnet mask
Set the ports
Click ‘Save’ to save the rule

Available parameters
Action:
There are 2 possible actions in the ‘Action’ drop-down list: ‘Accept’ or ‘Deny’. These specify whether the
rule will whitelist (‘accept’) or blacklist (‘deny’) the service that has been selected in the XChange.
Direction:
There are 3 directions available in the ‘Direction’ drop-down list: ‘In’, ‘Out’ and ‘Both’. These specify
whether the rule will accept the service for incoming ‘In’ or outgoing ‘Out’ communication only.
To enable a service to have bidirectional communication, use the preset ‘Both’ option.
IP Protocol/Services:
‘Protocol’ and ‘Service’ define which protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.) or services (FTP, DNS, etc.) will be
affected by the rule.
‘Protocol’ enables the creation of traffic profiles based on network layer 3 protocols (ICMP) or layer 4
protocols (UDP, TCP). Go to the following link for more details:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model.

List of preconfigured protocols
•
•
•

ICMP: Network control protocol. Mostly used by ping and trace-route to check network paths
and connectivity
TCP:Connection-oriented reliable transport protocol. Concerns most Internet-based
applications (web browsing, email, file transfer, etc.)
UDP:
Connectionless ‘best effort’ transport protocol. Mostly used for streaming
applications and server name resolution

The preconfigured protocols are displayed in the ‘Expert Mode’ and in ‘Filter Rules’ overviews.

The preconfigured services are only displayed in ‘Easy Mode’.

Rules Sequence
When more than one rule is configured, it is important to make sure that the sequence of rules is in the
correct order. The XChange firewall will treat incoming and outgoing traffic sequentially, based on the
order in which the rules are displayed from top to bottom.
The 1st rule in the list is treated first (followed by the 2nd rule, and so on). Rules in the wrong order are
likely to produce unexpected behaviour.
In order to change the sequence, use the up/down arrows on the left to move the rules.

9.6.3 Edit a Firewall Filter
To edit a firewall filter, go to BOX SETTINGS > Network > Firewall and select the specific filter.
Click ‘Edit’ to enter the page on firewall filter details. On this page, you can:

Please note
To avoid unwanted firewall behaviour, you can only delete a firewall filter when there is no
User group or terminal associated with this filter.

9.7 Inter-LAN Access Management
The “Inter-LAN” management allows setting up access rules between different LANs managed by
XChange. It allows specific network clients connected on different networks, with different IP address
schemes, to communicate directly.
The overview page shows a list of existing inter-LAN access rules, their status and offers to add, delete
or edit rules.

The option is very simple and can be configured on a flexible way. From full access between networks,
up to very restricted, secured, access just between 2 network clients through a specific Protocol and
Port.
Optionally, an internal ‘NATing’ can be activated per rule. If activated, the destination system will
receive requests from the XChange-IP within the same network. If not activated, the destination
system will receive requests from the original IP address of the accessing computer.
The Inter-LAN rules are based on internal networking and IPs. All rules work bi-directional. This
means, just one rule must be defined to allow a inter-LAN communication between 2 systems. There is
no need to create unique rules for requests and answers. No user-based access management is
offered herewith.
The overview page shows a list of existing inter-LAN access rules, their status and offers to add, delete
or edit rules.

Please note
The system does not check for conflicts between those rules. It´s not recommended to
create more than 50 access rules.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

9.7.1

Examples for Inter-LAN rules:

Access to a Web Server on LAN 1 from the whole LAN2:

Full access between all LAN1 and LAN2 network clients: (Not Recommended!)

Access to a Web Server on LAN1 from some computer on LAN2:
In this example, 14 clients of LAN2 can access the Web Server. If specific PCs should access a system
on another LAN, one rule per accessing computer should be setup.

Access to a Web Server on LAN1 from one specific computer on LAN2:

9.7.2

Creation of Inter-LAN rules

To add a new inter-LAN rule, click the ‘Add’ button and fill all required information according the
needs.

Fields to be added and their meaning:
-

-

“Name”: Set a unique name
“Source Address”: IP address(es) of clients which should access another client
“Source Mask”: Subnet mask to restrict granted IP addresses to access
“Destination Address”: IP address(es) of the system to be accessible
“Destination Mask”: Subnet mask to restrict the number of accessible IP addresses
“Protocol”: Option to limit communication to a specific protocol:
o ICMP
o IGMP
o TCP
o UDP
o ALL
“Destination Port or Range”: Option to limit communication to a specific or to a range of ports
“Enable NAT”: If checked, the accessing IP address will be masquerated with XChange´s own
IP
“Activation Status”: To enable or disable any rule

Once all details are checked, press the ‘Save’ button to store the new rule.
Automatic check of entered rules:
The system does not check for conflicts between different rules. The system checks if the combination
of IP address and subnet mask is valid. If wrong information is used, the system will decline to save a
faulty rule:

9.8 DNS Management
The DNS management option is an embedded DNS Server in the onboard XChange system. It allows
the Domain Name Resolution execution locally on board, by XChange. The local DNS server is fully
combinable with the inter-LAN access, offering a very user friendly way to manage access to for
instance Web Servers. Thanks to the DNS server, users do not need to remember the IP address of the
system to access, but a simple local domain can be remembered instead. Further the DNS server can
be used to simplify access to shore-based systems if a VPN Network between the XChange and the
Headquarter network is established.

The DNS management offers local and a remote domains to be created.
Local Domains:
Local domains are used to simplify the access to systems/servers locally on board.
External Domains:
External domains can be used to add simple domain names for any server / IP address outside the
XChange network, such as for example servers in the Headquarter network.

Please note
The external Domain option can bypass any DNS Blacklist- or Whitelist options defined.
Please validate, that any external domain setup is valid.
It´s not recommended to setup any domain name of existing internet sites such as for
example “google.com” to avoid conflicts.

9.8.1

Adding new DNS entries

The instructions, how to add a new DNS entry is identical for ‘Local Domains’ and ‘External Domains’.
To add a new DNS entry, click the ‘Add’ button and fill the fields accordingly.

Click ‘Save’ to store the new DNS entry.

 The domain name must be written in small letters only. Capital letters are not possible. Depending
on the used systems on board, the domain ‘.local’ should be avoided to avoid future complications if a
Linux-based system is used.

9.8.2

Edit DNS entries

To edit an existing DNS entry, or to change the activation status, mark the rule and click the ‘Editoption’ button required.

 The

-icon next to the IP address informs, if no network client uses this IP address.

9.9 DNS Blacklisting
A DNS blacklisting is setup centrally and acts on the whole vessel. Blacklisted domains cannot be
access by any person or system on board, independent of the user group or communication device in
use. Onboard it is not possible to edit the DNS Blacklisting feature. Exclusively through Portal 360 it is
possible to activate and define blacklisted DNS entries.
Blacklisted DNS can be searched by simply typing at least 4 digits.

9.10

Blocked Suspicious Systems

The new MAC address Blacklisting empowers Marlink´s Cyber Detection service.
The MAC Blacklisting feature manages a blacklist of MAC Addresses which are blocked from external
communication. Following the detection of a threat using Cyber Detection, a typical short-term
corrective action is to quarantine the infected machine(s) so that it/they can no longer communicate
externally. After having resolved the threat on the infected machine(s), these can be removed from the
MAC blacklist and they will be able to communicate externally again

9.11

Remote Management

The remote management functionality is required to allow User, credit administration or IT
configuration management from shore via Portal360 without the need to remotely access an XChange.
By default, the remote management function is enabled. This page provides additional information,
such as assigned IP address for trouble shoot purposes.

WARNING
Remote management is a core functionality for XChange shore-based management.
Marlink recommends not disabling this function, even if it is not in daily use. Even unused
remote management enables shore-based support teams to provide on-board support
without the need for remote access.

XChange File Cloud

The Cloud-section allows the captain to keep the available cloud storage-quota in mind to identify
early enough if the Cloud storage-quota is already reached and needs to be cleaned up.
The Administrator can check the used storage-quota per Cloud account and manage the Cloud
configuration details:

By clicking the ‘Synchronise Now’ button, the cloud synchronisation will start immediately to check if
new files must be uploaded from ship to shore or vice versa.

9.12.1

File Synchronisation

Within the ‘Cloud Settings’ the file synchronisation mechanism can be de-/activated and the period
between two synchronisation attempts can be defined.
To start/stop the Cloud file synchronisation mechanism, click the button next to ‘Synchronisation’ and
click ‘Save’.

During the time the synchronisation is disabled, the XChange Cloud folders and the content will not be
accessible on board. To reactivate the local network access, enable the file synchronisation again.

WARNING
It is not recommended to disable the Cloud synchronisation mechanism for more than 1
day, because this setting can influence the actuality of the content stored within XChange
Cloud. If the synchronisation is reactivated after a longer period, it may occur that a huge
number of files are being synchronised which can lead into a occupied bandwidth for a
longer time.
9.12.2

Synchronisation Period

The ‘Synchronisation Period’ shows the number of hours between two file synchronisation attempts.
Per default, the period is set to once per hour. Independent of the contracted synchronisation
frequency, the system will check automatically if new content is available. Once the contracted
frequency is reached, the file transmission will start automatically.
To change the synchronisation period, type the preferred amount of hours.

Click ‘Save’ to store the new setting.
9.12.3 Manage Local Cloud Access
Onboard, the XChange Cloud can be access from any local network by any user or system being
allowed to access.
The access technologies on the local network are:
•
•

Local Network Drive (Samba) SMBv2 / SMB v. 3.0
Local SFTP

For security reasons it is recommended to only allow the technology used and to disable the other. To
disable one technology, click the radio button and click the ‘Save’ button.

10.Remote Access Settings
The XChange embeds multiple remote access features. To access the remote access area, go to BOX
SETTINGS > Network > Remote Access.

The ‘Remote Access’ overview displays multiple weblets, each representing one remote access
feature.

10.1

XChange Universal Remote Access (URA)

XChange ‘Universal Remote Access’ (URA) is a separate premium feature within XChange. Any
XChange customer can order the XChange URA service at any time. There is no need for on-board
attendance to activate this service.
Using the XChange URA service makes remote access simpler and more flexible. The XChange URA
service is completely embedded within the XChange system minimising the need for configuration.
URA is based on ‘Open-VPN’ and using encrypted communication as a standard.
There is NO need to configure trusted clients or port-forwarding rules to make use of the XChange URA
service.
XChange Universal Remote Access should stay activated even without an active XChange URA
subscription.

Please note
Any remote access service that is set to start automatically at device activation (‘Device
Settings’) will automatically reconnect if you deactivate it in the ‘Remote Access Area’.

Please note
The XChange Universal Remote Access service is enabled so that Marlink support can be
available in case of an issue. Marlink support will request that the XChange URA service be
activated manually by the Master if automatic start is not enabled.

XChange Administrator Handbook 5.6

© Marlink ● Page 165/204

10.1.1

XChange URA Prerequisites

A valid URA user account and the latest available URA client software are required to connect to an
XChange with activated URA service.
To ensure a working XChange URA service, the XChange Firewalls shall allow XChange URA
communication always, through any communication device.
XChange Universal Remote Access requires access to the Internet that allows outbound connections
on TCP port 443 (https) and UDP/TCP port 1194 (VPN).

WARNING
If the XChange Firewall does not have the required XChange URA ports whitelisted, then it
will be blocked. Marlink does not take any responsibility for issues with the XChange URA
service if the firewall is not set up correctly.

10.2.2

Manual Support Remote Access Initialisation

When automatic start of the support remote access is disabled, it can be initialised manually. It is then
possible to remotely access the XChange or terminals on the WAN side.
To initialise the service:
•
•

Go to BOX SETTINGS > Network > Overview
Click ‘OFF’ to launch the remote access service (the button changes to ‘ON’)

When the service is initialised, a data connection using a Public IP will be launched (FleetBroadband).

To access a terminal on the WAN side, the Administrator needs to use the incoming port pointing to the
desired terminal, for example, https://<public_ip_address>:PORT

 Tip!! While using a different device than FleetBroadband, the Public IP address cannot be retrieved by the
XChange.

To find out your current Public IP address, start a data session and browse to http://www.myipaddress.com. If
the Public IP address is properly forwarded to the device interface (depending on the network’s shore
configuration), then the shore Administrator will be able to access the XChange.

Before the XChange can be accessed remotely via an autonomous device, ensure that ‘Port Forwarding’ is set up
correctly on this device, pointing to ports 444 and 22.

11.8

XChange Security Certificates

The XChange synchronises in the background with Marlink´s XChange servers hosted within Marlink´s
premises at shore, at regular intervals.
During this synchronisation for example freshly created log-entries are transmitted to the shore or
XChange optional premium services are activated if ordered.
This synchronisation is based on secured and encrypted ‘HTTPS’ connection.
For security reasons, the XChange uses HTTPS certificates which are regularly updated automatically
to ensure highest possible security.
After a factory reset, or in cases an XChange service seems not to work properly, a check for updates of
those security certificates is required.
To check and potentially update a security certificate, go to Box Settings > System > Certificates:

To check for updates, select one certificate after the next.
Once a certificate is selected, press the button “Check Availability”:
The system will check with the XChange server if that security certificate is still UpToDate and if not,
the latest one will be downloaded in the background.
If the installed certificate is already the latest one, this popup message confirms the validity:

You can close the popup message and check the next certificate.
If a newer certificate version is found on the server, below message is displayed:

The system will automatically download and install the newer certificate in the background. You can
close the popup message and check the next certificate.
