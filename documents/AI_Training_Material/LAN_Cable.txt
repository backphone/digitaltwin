True, auto-sensing ports eliminate the need to think about whether you're using cross over or straight through. But, as mentioned, it is probably safer to practice good networking rules.
 
 
Note: The correct method to connect a router to a switch is by using a straight through cable. Switches and Hubs transmit on pins 3 & 6, where as pretty much any other NIC's and Router's transmit on pins 1 & 2.
 
 
 
 
 
So :
 
 
router to router....crossover
 
 
PC to PC....crossover
 
 
switch to switch.....crossover
 
 
PC to router....crossover
 
 
PC to switch, Router to switch, PC to Hub....straight-through
