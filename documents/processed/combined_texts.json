  "Antenna_check.txt": "Thank you for your feedback. Please make sure that all coaxial cables connected to the iDirect modem and Intellian antenna control unit are not damaged and connected properly. Trace the black thin flexible cables connected to the antenna control unit until thick black cables, which go up to the antenna dome. Kindly check this connection as well.\n \nWhen cables have been inspected:\n1.     turn off the iDirect modem, on the antenna control unit press the M button to enter the setup mode and leave antenna control unit powered on.\n2.     Go up to the antenna dome and open the hatch door, located the TEST switch on the Main Control Unit, move it to the TEST position.\n3.     Move the antenna with hands in elevation to approximately 45° and carefully release. Antenna is stabilized and should hold the position. Report back whether antenna can or cannot hold the position.\n4.     Please repeat the last step several times, with random elevation angle.\n5.     Check the stability in cross-level axis. Tilt the cross-bar from horizontal position and check, if antenna can hold the position.\n6.     Check the condition and tension of belt, which drives the antenna in elevation, located on the right side panel.\n7.     Check the condition and tension of belt, which drives the antenna in cross-level. Belt is located in the center, where main pedestal and horizontal cross-bar meets.\n8.     Lastly, observe the antenna movement during initializing. Move the TEST switch back to Normal position and restart the antenna with power switch (right from the hatch door).\na.     Sensor Box (on the right side panel, the box with bubble/spirit level) will drive backwards, find level and lift antenna up to 45 degrees in elevation.\nb.    Antenna will tilt over in cross level, then move back and stabilize the cross-bar.\nc.     Antenna starts moving in azimuth until it reaches a sensor (little green box at the base of the antenna) and stops when pointing towards the bow (or parallel with the bow/aft line, if the antenna is installed on starboard or port side).\nd.    Please report back anything unusual during the initialization.\n9.     Close the hatch door and turn on the iDirect modem.\n ",
  "check_home_sensor_v110.txt": "\n\n1.     Go inside the antenna dome and switch off the power.\n2.     Turn the antenna in AZ with hands and find the home switch and the bracket (see attached picture) and visually check if they are not loose. Make sure that cable for the home sensor is connected properly to the cable interface box.\n3.     Switch on the antenna and observe the antenna initialization. Last initialization step is AZ initialization. Antenna will turn in AZ until the home sensor meets the metal bracket. The sensor includes the LED light, this LED should turn ON when the metal is being detected. Is this LED light turning on?\n\n\n\n\n\nRemoved the two holding screws of the sensor & inspected the Sensor found visibly perfect. Fixed back & switched on the Antenna unit\n\n\n",

  "BUC_power_cable_swap.txt": "When you look closer to the power switch unit, there is another spare BUC power cable. But this cable is for another radio type (Codan). One end of this cable is located at the power switch unit. Then this cable runs through the black power ring and then it goes up to the BUC, where it is hanging, not connected, labeled as BUC (Codan).\n\n1. Please disconnect current NJRC power cable from the power switch unit and connect BUC(Codan) cable instead. 2. Then measure the DC voltage on the other end (cable hanging on BUC side). If you manage to measure the DC voltage while BUC (codan) cable is in use, that will indicate that BUC(NJRC) cable or the its power ring section is broken. 3. If this is the case, then power ring needs to be replaced.\n\nThere is a chance to use the BUC (Codan) cable, only thing that needs to be done is to replace the connector on the radio side, because the military plug for Codan radio is smaller and will not fit to the NJRC radio. When you look closer on the NJRC military plug, there are very small letters linked to each power pin. Those are labeled as A and B. Pin A is the + and pin B is the - pole. If you don’t manage to disassemble those military plugs to get them swapped, you can cut the cable and just interconnect good cable (BUC-Codan cable) with NJRC military plug (you can solder those wires or use some terminal strip to get wires interconnected. Then later the whole power ring can be replaced when you are back in port. The power ring has 3 pair of channels for the power and sometimes it might happen that one channel fails, while other channels still can be used.\n\nI know that this is quite complicated procedure, but some skilled electricians have done this procedure before and made the system temporary working, before our technician managed to get on board.\n\nPlease let me know if you think you can follow this procedure or if you have any other questions.",

  "page_90.txt": "Intellian’s LP100 land terminal meets Korean military’s need for portable, swift-to-deploy communications | Intelliantech\nBack to listing\nCase Study\nIntellian’s LP100 land terminal meets Korean military’s need for portable, swift-to-deploy communications\nDate\n01 September 2020\nLocation\nAPAC - Military and Government\nMilitary and Government - LP100\nCustomer: Korean Military\nMarket Sector: Military & Government\nRequired Features: Man-Portable & Rapid Deployment\nChallenges\nReliable connectivity in a challengeable environment\nMan-portable antenna for ease of deployment in theater\nQuick installation and commissioning\nFor network-centric operations to succeed on today’s digital battlefield, efficient, reliable, and real-time communication is crucial to deliver the right information to the right person at the right time. The antenna is one of the most important elements in the communication channel. Military applications combine the need for high performance and reliability with some of the harshest environmental conditions.\nThe Korean military expects to deploy the system in a range of diverse situations, including emergencies, disaster recovery, SOC (Social Overhead Capital) projects in the domestic arena or abroad, and in defense applications. The requirements they asked for were basically the same requirements Intellian has developed for maritime applications; the same key qualities that have made Intellian a global leader in satellite communications.\nSo, it was logical that when the need arose for an intelligent VSAT antenna, which could establish a stable data communication service yet be easily assembled and disassembled, stored, and moved without mechanical assistance, the Korean military looked to Intellian to provide the solution.\nSolutions\nMil-spec man-portable land terminal, LP100 ‘Flyaway’\nAutomatic acquisition to target the satellite\nAutomatic and manual capability to stow the antenna ready for transport\nIntellian’s LP100 ‘flyaway’ land terminal can be carried in two airline-checkable backpacks and deployed in minutes with no tools required. Each reflector section is interchangeable, removing complexity and allowing the unit to be built in the dark, while the constructed antenna sits low to the ground – essential attributes for covert operations. From packed to connected within five minutes, the LP100 is ideal for portable and truly global communications.\nSatellite tracking is achieved with a single button press, as is stowing for transport, although both can be achieved manually if required. Capable of operating on AC or DC power (from a vehicle), the unit will switch automatically between power sources to ensure uninterrupted, stable operation even when power sources are unpredictable. Local and remote management and diagnostics are made simple through the built-in Aptus web interface.\nThe Intellian LP100 is upgradable from Ku-band to Ka-band, for when the military and government prefer to use Ka-band frequencies. New Ka-band networks are built with smaller, steerable beams for high capacity density, which adds enhanced jamming resistance for platforms while supporting significant uplink data rates for programs such as military Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and other data-rich applications.\nThe Korean Military launched their first satellite which utilizes Ka-band, resulting in Intellian being selected as the sole vendor. The LP100 can be quickly and easily upgraded to Ka-band with few component changes in the field.\nBenefits\nLightweight, rugged, and man-portable for soldiers to mobilize\nNo tools required for ease of deployment\nWith a modular antenna assembly that can be completed in a few minutes\nFuture proof – Ka-band upgradable\nFully compatible with all major service providers, the LP100 flyaway antenna can be swiftly converted between Ku- and Ka-band operation by swapping the central feed and RF assembly, an operation taking less than five minutes. The Korean military is one of the first organizations to take advantage of the stable, portable high-speed data communication facilitated by the LP100, but since the early stages of development, the LP100 flyaway has been focused on by the global defense markets and is currently being evaluated by the defense industries in the United States and Europe.\nDownloads\nPDF version\nIntellian Case Study Mil Gov Market LP100 Military\nDownload Latest\nRequest Information\nContact Us\nFor further detailed information on the Intellian products and solutions shown here, please submit your request using this convenient form.\nFind out more",

  "page_83.txt": "Intellian Delivers First Production Space Force Hybrid Terminal to the US Navy; ARC-M4 Block 1 (AN/USC-75) Completes WGS certification | Intelliantech\nBack to listing\nPress Release\nIntellian Delivers First Production Space Force Hybrid Terminal to the US Navy; ARC-M4 Block 1 (AN/USC-75) Completes WGS certification\nDate\n30 September 2024\nIrvine California, USA. September 30  2024\n–\nIntellian Technologies Inc.\n, Intellian Technologies, the leading provider of feature-rich maritime satellite communications solutions, announces that the\nARC-M4 Block 1\nhas received WGS certification, and is known as the AN/USC-75 in the JETDAS system.\nThe AN/USC-75 is already operationally deployed supporting critical expeditionary missions for its user community.  It is the first tri-band terminal deployed for the surface fleet certified to deliver high-capacity SATCOM services on both commercial and military satellites, supporting four different orbits (GEO/MEO/LEO/HEO).\nCompletion of the ARC-M4 Block 1 WGS certification is a testament to Intellian’s commitment to provide ultra-high throughput systems for enduring Wideband SATCOM service needs for the US Navy and its allies. The ARC-M4 Block 1 preserves, diversifies, and enhances the US Navy’s continued access to the WGS/DSCS constellations, while embracing the Navy’s focus on Pre-Planned Product Improvements (P3I) strategy to support current and future constellations of interest.\nThe ARC-M4 Block 1 represents the first modern hybrid Naval terminal, enabling the US and its allies to utilize MILSATCOM/WGS and COMSATCOM assets with a single terminal, providing vastly improved waveform diversity, blockage mitigation technologies, unprecedented ease of use, training, implementation, operations, and superior performance over legacy terminals.\nThe US Space Force and the DoD CIO have identified “hybrid terminals” as their ultimate goal in fielding next-generation terminals for multi-orbit warfare communications environments because our fighting forces cannot field unique terminals for each and every constellation that the services may want to use.  Originally called “Fighting SATCOM,” the idea is that the US military needs terminals that support the SHF frequencies, waveforms, and their orbits, as at the time of need.  Intellian has delivered that exact system for all maritime environments.\nWGS is a high-capacity United States Space Force satellite communication constellation providing X- and military Ka-band services, in partnership with Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, The Netherlands, and a growing list of other partner nation’s Ministries of Defense.\nIntellian’s ARC-M4 Block 1 terminal is certified for simultaneous X- and multi-carrier Military Ka-Band operations on WGS and all frequency bands are electronically switched.  The ARC-M4 Block 1 (AN/USC-75) is Intellian’s second wideband terminal approved for use on the WGS satellite constellation by the United States Space Force, Space Delta 8 (USSF), without any stipulations or restrictions\nThe ARC-M4 Block 1 is certified for use now on WGS, XTAR, SES O3b mPOWER, and Viasat’s Global Xpress (GX) commercial and High Capacity Military Ka-Band payloads. Other constellations of merit are pending approval, including a software update to support HEO orbit.\nThe Intelligent Mediator 8 (IM8) is a critical component of the WGS certified configuration.  The IM8 provides automated complex blockage mitigation between port and starboard terminals, as well as frequency control, waveform, and orbit mediation and is part of a policy-based connectivity expression and delivery system.  The IM8 is controlled via Intellian’s award-winning AptusNX user interface that simply allows connectivity across multiple arcs, frequencies, and waveforms.\nThe ARC-M4 Block 1 presents an unprecedented improvement in overall RF performance compared to legacy Navy SHF systems of similar SWAP, such as the CBSP Unit Level Variant (ULV) and the SHF Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT).  More importantly, the ARC-M4 Block 1 is the first no-compromise multi-role maritime terminal in the US Navy’s arsenal supporting multiple missions, operating in multiple roles, on multiple bands simultaneously.\nIntellian is pleased to further announce that the ARC-M4 Block 1 is now in volume production and is accepting orders for immediate delivery.\nEdward Joannides, VP of Strategy & Business Development for Intellian USA said: “We understand the critical importance that our products provide to the US Government, its coalition and allied Warfighters. Our unwavering commitment empowers resilient communications architectures, giving them the mission agility and mission readiness they need. Obtaining WGS certification is a challenging and rigorous process, and the ARC-M4 Block 1 is testament to our dedication.  Delivering the first hybrid maritime SATCOM terminal to the Navy demonstrates our support for national defense.”\nAbout Intellian Technologies, Inc.\nIntellian is driven by a passion for innovation and an agile responsiveness to customer needs. As the crucial link between satellite networks and millions of people on Earth, Intellian’s leading technology and antennas empower global connectivity across oceans and continents, organizations and communities. Strategic thinking, an obsession with quality and a proven ability to deliver enables Intellian to invent for the future, creating mutual success for partners and customers as the world’s connectivity needs evolve.

Communication is achieved by using different frequency Bands, including C-Band, Ku-Band, Ka-Band, and L-Band.\nA satellite operator owns and manages fleets of satellites strategically placed in orbit, forming a network around the Earth providing global coverage. Types of orbits include low Earth orbit (LEO), medium Earth orbit (MEO) and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO).\nCustomers can go to an Intellian Authorized Reseller to buy a subscription service to a satellite network best suited for their needs and if they are on land, at sea or in the air, and an Intellian antenna or terminal. The Intellian antenna connects to and from the subscribed network’s nearest satellite in space, enabling access to the service and empowering connectivity.\nHow do I get internet and Wi-Fi on a boat?\nUsing satellite communications, you can get internet to your boat and then set up Wi-Fi for everyone on board to access. You will need a subscription to a satellite network service and an Intellian antenna installed which connects to the satellite network, delivering internet from space to the vessel. Part of the installation includes a ‘Below Deck Unit’ which you can use to connect your Wi-Fi router.\nGo to Where to Buy and find an Intellian Authorized Reseller, who can start the process today.\nWhat is a VSAT antenna?\nA VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) antenna is a type of satellite antenna that is used for two-way satellite communication. VSAT antennas are typically smaller than traditional satellite antennas and have a diameter of around 0.45m to 2.4m, making them suitable for installation on boats or land.\nWhat’s the difference between a satellite dish, antenna, terminal and radome?\nSatellite dish: often used as a generic phrase to describe a parabolic shaped reflector which many      satellite communication solutions are.\nAntenna: can send and receive satellite communication signals but has a separate modem.\nTerminal: can also send and receive satellite communication signals and has an integrated modem.\nRadome: the dome-shaped protective device used to house the antenna or terminal.\nWhat are the different types of VSAT antennas?\nThere are several types of VSAT antennas:\nFixed: These antennas are designed to be permanently installed in one location, like a building. The network operator would have a Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) for these customers.\nMobile: Comms on the move (COTM) antennas are designed to be used while on the move. This can include boats, vehicles, trains. The network operator would have a Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) for these customers.\nPortable: Comms on the pause (COTP) antennas are designed to be portable and easy to transport to then unpack and set it in a location for stationary use, before packing up and moving again. They are for temporary communication needs by adventurers, media and governments.\nWhat satellite networks do VSAT antennas work on?\nVSAT antennas work on all satellite networks subject to them being Type Approved (certified and allowed by the satellite operator for use on the network). L-Band networks don’t use VSAT antennas because that frequency requires a different type of user terminal.\nWhat are the different Frequency Bands that Intellian’s antennas work on?\nIntellian have a range of antennas that work across the spectrum. These include: C-Band, L-Band, Ka-Band and Ku-Band.\nIs an antenna easy to install?\nIntellian recommend always using a qualified professional who has been trained on how to best install your antenna to ensure a successful installation and not to void your warranty. Installation is typically two phases – the physical aspect of getting the antenna and other hardware safely in place and secured, then configuring the antenna to connect to the satellite network.\nShould I service an antenna?\nYes, like all hardware with mechanical parts regular maintenance ensures best results and can help extend the lifespan of your product. A professional service partner will check the antenna for any wear and tear, checking and adjusting the alignment, and checking the cables and connections. Intellian sell spare parts kits to easily replace items that might have accelerated wear.\nAre VSAT antennas affected by weather conditions?\nIn bad weather conditions it’s typically the strength of the satellite network’s signal that gets weakened, known as rain-fade, rather than a VSAT antenna being impacted. This is more common in the higher frequencies such as Ka-Band and Ku-Band. L-Band is notoriously resilient to rain-fade which is why it’s used for safety services.\nThe curved design of Intellian radomes help prevent rain or snow to settle, which would impact line of sight to the satellite. Intellian antennas have maximum operational temperature ranges, and some have optional heating or cooling solutions to extend the operational temperature range. These are recommended if it’s known that the temperatures in which the antenna will be located could be hitting peak operational range.",

Extreme temperatures, corrosive saltwater, constant vibration and high winds are just some of the conditions in which satellite networks need to be deployed and run. These are very basic challenges that drill rig operators face on a daily bases.\nAdditionally, reliable and constant connectivity is another major requirement. While an offshore network’s capabilities must go beyond enterprise reliability, even some industrial-grade wireless networks are not suited to an offshore operation, where all assets are constantly in motion.

  "page_36.txt": "Intellian’s v100 connects Northwest Canadian logging operation for robust communication in all conditions | Intelliantech\nBack to listing\nCase Study\nIntellian’s v100 connects Northwest Canadian logging operation for robust communication in all conditions\nDate\n01 September 2020\nLocation\nGlobal - Merchant\nMerchant Market - v100\nCustomer: Galaxy Broadband Seacoast Electronic\nMarket Sector: Commercial\nRequired Features: KA Services in the North West Electronics High Bandwidth\nWith a history stretching back to the 1930s, Canfor prides itself on being one of the world’s largest producers of sustainable lumber, pulp, and paper, in addition to being one of North America’s most preeminent sources of green energy production. The forest territory of Mackenzie, directly north of British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan interior, is one of the company’s key working areas; and the scale of Canfor’s logging operations in this region is, to say the least, impressive.\nCanfor owns an ice-breaking, log-carrying vessel called the MV Williston Transporter which spends its working life on Mackenzie’s Williston Lake; a 164,000-hectare body of water which constitutes the largest man-made reservoir in North America. The vessel itself is, of necessity, a substantial craft; 360ft long and 110ft wide, it is capable of carrying a 5,000-tonne payload. It is tasked with traveling to the various logging sites and transporting logs a distance of 65km across Williston Lake. This journey takes an average of four-and-a-half hours one way during summer months, but the same process can take six hours or more in the winter, as ice begins to form on the lake surface.\nChallenges\nRequested Ka-band satellite services for maritime in the Northwest Territories of Canada\nRequested reliable connections to shore 24/7 for 10 months of the year\nMonitoring and coordinating 24/7 logging operations over long distances, for 10 months out of every year, in a broad range of weather conditions, can present many challenges. The safety and efficiency of Canfor’s industry in Mackenzie depends upon reliable, high-quality communications between the logging sites and the ship on Williston Lake. With this in mind, Canfor pledged to invest in the most trusted, robust and cost-effective broadband solution available.\nSolutions\nIntellian v100Ka tracking antenna\nEase of integration with the modem edge technologies and high power transmission\nCanfor approached, the Canadian satellite service provider, Galaxy Broadband and one of the firm’s resellers, to discuss their requirements for a satellite solution that would include voice and data for the MV Williston Transporter on Williston Lake. Galaxy, in turn, contacted Intellian, the leading global provider of stabilized satellite antenna systems, to partner with them in setting up what was destined to become the first Ka-band marine system in North America.\nThis partnership provided everything Canfor required. Galaxy’s fourth-generation SkyCARRIER IP-over-satellite service, which functions on an MCPC (Multi-Channel Per Carrier), offered 20Mbps burst speeds and multiple VoIP over satellite phone lines aboard the vessel while Intellian provided the stable, high performing v100Ka 1m VSAT platform. Live network tests confirmed Intellians reputation as one of the world’s best-performing and most accurate tracking Ka-band marine systems. After testing Intellian’s VSAT platform, the v100Ka was selected to connect the MV Williston Transporter to the network. The gain and optimized tracking performance of the Intellian v100 delivered a solid platform to provide reliable and consistent communication for a ship in this remote area.\nThe v100Ka’s high-gain, highly efficient reflector and tuned radome ensure the best service quality available. In addition, the v100Ka supports a low elevation angle (-20°) capability to guarantee reliable connection at extremely high altitudes.\nIn the event that support is required, Intellian's Aptus software allows shore-based staff to remotely troubleshoot, diagnose, and update terminals from shore without setting foot aboard the ship. This feature greatly reduces costly service visits and cuts downtime from days to minutes.\nBenefits\nConsistent business communications and logistics\nReliable connections for business and crew welfare\nCanfor saw immediately improvement when they were able to maintain voice calls and deliver operational information to the ship seamlessly. Business and operations also received an additional boost. The outcome has been positive for the crew, the loggers on Mackenzie’s logging sites, and the business.\nNow that the antenna upgrade is complete, everyone on board the vessel has access to a true broadband experience. With burst speeds up to 20Mbps, facilitated by the Intellian v100Ka’s strong and consistent signal reception, the MV Williston Transporter’s ship-to-shore communications are more rapid and straightforward than they have ever been before. No more voice drop-out or packet loss as data travels back and forth along the information highway.\nSolution Partner:\nGalaxy Broadband\nDownloads\nPDF version\nIntellian Case Study Commercial Galaxy Broadband\nDownload Latest\nRequest Information\nContact Us\nFor further detailed information on the Intellian products and solutions shown here, please submit your request using this convenient form.\nFind out more",

  "page_74.txt": "Intellian’s compact, lightweight and affordable v60E antenna proves its value at sea | Intelliantech\nBack to listing\nCase Study\nIntellian’s compact, lightweight and affordable v60E antenna proves its value at sea.\nDate\n01 September 2020\nLocation\nGlobal - Commercial Fishing\nCommercial Fishing - v60E\nCustomer: Syntelix\nMarket Sector: Fishing\nRequired Features: Compact size, affordable, outstanding performance\nIn the world of maritime satellite communications, the principles of supply and demand are more nuanced than might be consider at first glance. Hardware and software manufacturers need to stay closer to their customers and partners to be able to identify and properly address the requirements of a specific market. A recent demonstration on how particular demands of certain maritime communities can be precisely met with an appropriate new product was the case of the fast-growing international niche satellite communication solutions provider, Syntelix and its desire to serve fishing vessels with good coverage and outstanding speeds.\nChallenges\nReliable but economical VSAT terminal development\nCompact, light-weight and affordable antenna with outstanding performance for smaller vessel operators\nSyntelix has rapidly made its name as a state-of-the-art supplier delivering fully integrated, end-to-end satellite technology. The firm’s dedicated maritime arm, USAIL, is primarily focused on providing satellite communication solutions for clients in the fishing industry and owners of mid-sized yachts, but its packages also promise unlimited internet access at sea for vessels including regional merchant ships, ferries, tugs and patrol boats.\nSyntelix is one of the latest companies to become an Intellian partner and is known for excellence in Engineering and Service delivery.\nThe challenge for Intellian was to produce an antenna that, while keeping essential features, kept pricing within the budget of smaller-vessel operators who normally wouldn’t consider a VSAT system and match the outstanding RF performance of the higher-cost 65cm antennas within the Intellian portfolio.\nSolutions\nIntellian v60E terminals with AptusNX\nEase of integration across all competitive modem brands\nGiven the predominance of small and ‘mid-market’ vessels among its customer base, Syntelix/USAIL had been on the lookout for a lightweight, affordable, dependable and well-supported 65cm VSAT antenna system to serve their client base. Having successfully deployed Intellian VSAT and TVRO antennas before, the company was quick to respond to the news of Intellian’s new v60E Ku-band VSAT, becoming the first provider in Europe to conduct sea trials with the antenna.\nThe v60E’s system weighs 42kg which is 18kg lighter than existing 65cm class VSAT antennas such as our v60G or v65. The lighter weight makes it suitable for smaller vessels and boats, as well as reducing freight and installation costs, lowering the total cost of ownership.\nIn comparison with other 65cm antenna systems, the v60E’s RF design delivers higher levels of performance, with in-house designed reflector, feeder and RF components. Intellian design and manufacture highly efficient and affordable parabolic reflectors. In addition, world-class RF component design experts can provide the most powerful and efficient antennas ever.\nBenefits\nAble to provide cost effective end-to-end satellite communication solutions to Syntelix’s customers in the fishing industry and owners of mid-sized yachts delivering Internet services to ships that were not served before with broadband connectivity\nAble to integrate the system to Syntelix’s network with Intellian’s engineering, delivery and support teams\nTo the satisfaction of all relevant parties, the v60E delivered excellent tracking and performance on the sea trials. Thanks to AptusNX, the installation and commission was simple and provided very robust monitoring capabilities on the dashboard during testing. The ease of integration with the iDirect Modem family and the imbedded management interface was a substantial value addition to the customer.\nSyntelix was able to integrate the system to their network thanks to the constant engineering engagement from Intellian and the support from the Solutions team. This has been highlighted as a key differentiator of Intellian business support, customer-facing philosophy, and partner engagement.\nSyntelix also encouraged Intellian to flip the Dual Modem Mediator functionality so that one system can enable two modems in the same band to automatically switch between two separate networks. “This solution can act as a back-up or a booster,” Carlos Derqui, co-founder and CEO of Syntelix, “giving users higher reliability plus all the benefits of regional coverage. It’s another indication that Intellian shares our business-friendly, customer-facing philosophy. From the beginning, the company has helped us to solve any problems we had, and the staff are always ready and willing to assist. We identified this quality very quickly: we’re a small company, and the human factor is very important.”\nSolution Partner:\nSyntelix\nDownloads\nPDF version\nIntellian Case Study Fishing Syntelix\nDownload Latest\nRequest Information\nContact Us\nFor further detailed information on the Intellian products and solutions shown here, please submit your request using this convenient form.\nFind out more",

It consists of dual 3 axis stabilized pedestals with 73 cm parabolic antennas providing 12 dB/K G/T performance. By allowing seamless and undisrupted connectivity for LEO handovers, this user terminal gives customers in remote and challenging environments access to a cost effective and enhanced user experience otherwise inaccessible to them.\nOW70L\nKey Features\nSpecifications\nDownloads\nWhere to Buy\nKey Features\nLow latency, fast speed\nProviding global coverage (including both poles) OneWeb’s 648 satellite constellation will provide fibre-like high speed, low latency connectivity to remote customers where terrestrial fibre connections are not possible. The OW70L-Dac operates in Ku-Band for minimum rain fade and is able to deliver unmatchable high-throughput, low-latency connectivity. For more details visit the\nOneWeb website.\nEasily deployable system\nDesigned with cost-effectiveness in mind, the OW70L-Dac is light in weight and designed for easy installation. With only a single cable needed to provide data and power between indoor and outdoor units, installation time is significantly reduced.\nLow-temperature performance\nUsing an elaborately designed heating device module, the OW70L-Dac ensures steady performance in extremely low temperatures, up to -40 degrees Celsius. OneWeb is the only LEO constellation committing to 100% coverage of Alaska and the OW70L-Dac will ensure people in the Arctic region will have access to affordable and reliable broadband services.\nHigh-performance\nThe technology behind our OW70L dual parabolic antennas integrates complex satellite communications technology into a simple UT specifically designed to meet the needs of many different sectors including small, medium and large enterprises. The OW70L is small and affordable compared with VSAT but with enhanced performance, it is able to provide fast-speed, low-latency and high capacity connectivity.\nLEO satellite scan and tracking algorithm\nThe Intellian OW70L-Dac provides seamless, undisrupted connectivity through a primary-secondary dual dome solution for consistent connection with LEO satellite handovers. The proven tracking performance can be achieved by precise technology which makes the secondary antenna track a rising satellite before the primary antenna loses a falling satellite.\n12 dB/K antennas with 3 axis stabilization\n3 axis stabilization allows easy tracking of LEO satellites\nA responsive cross-level beam helps to point the antenna in the right direction even when the elevation angle approaches ±90 degrees\n'Keyhole problem' avoidance design is implemented in the OW70L-Dac, which in turn enables the antenna to continue tracking normally even when the satellite is directly overhead\nSpecifications\nOneWeb\nRadome Dimension\n84.5x77 cm (33.3 x 30.3 inches)\nReflector Diameter\n73 cm/28.7 inches\nAntenna Weight (Primary antenna)\n33.0 kg/72.8 Ibs (33.6 kg/74.1 lbs - heating module installed condition)\nAntenna Weight (Secondary antenna)\n32.0 kg/70.5 Ibs (32.5 kg/71.7 lbs - heating module installed condition)\nTX Frequency\n14 GHz ~ 14.5 GHz\nRX Frequency\n10.7 GHz ~ 12.7 GHz\nTX Gain\n38.4 dBi\nRX Gain\n36.0 dBi\nG/T\n12.2 dB/K (@11.8 GHz)\nOneWeb\nDownloads\nOW70L-Dac\nDatasheet\nDownload Latest\nOW70L-Dac\nImage library\nDownload Latest\nWhere to Buy\nFind an Authorized OneWeb Seller\nWe sell through a global network of authorized Intellian resellers.

  "page_55.txt": "Intellian delivers seamless, home-like internet for cruise passengers through the tri-band v240MT antenna | Intelliantech\nBack to listing\nCase Study\nIntellian delivers seamless, home-like internet for cruise passengers through the tri-band v240MT antenna\nDate\n01 September 2020\nLocation\nGlobal - Cruise\nCruise - v240MT\nCustomer: Carnival\nMarket Sector: Cruise\nRequired Features: New antenna system to provide home-like internet to thousands of passengers on cruise vessels\nChallenges\nFor end-customers: Limited capacity and not enough speed to support thousands of passengers on a cruise ship\nFor cruise operators: Limited technology to create flexible service solutions utilizing multi-band and multi-orbits\nSeafarers have come to expect always-on internet services, on par with the ones used on land, as a matter of course. Allied to this is the expectation that the satellite technology cruise companies invest in will prove to be as cost-effective as it is efficient and will not be rendered obsolete overnight. Ticking all of these boxes can be asking too much across an extensive fleet, traversing far-flung areas of the globe, with multiple onboard internet users at any one time.\nUnlike other larger vessels, such as oil tankers and container ships, operating all around the globe with only a couple of dozen employees on board, cruise vessels carry thousands of people on board including guests and crew. As the demand for the internet grows with most land facilities providing Wi-Fi and transportation like aircraft and trains now also providing internet connections, consumer's expectation of constant mobile access is now the new norm.\nWith cruise navigation routes encompassing all the oceans, the need for technology to allow frequency band switching and tracking, locking onto the next available satellite to receive and transmit enough data to satisfy the ever data-hungry guests is as critical as operational communication to navigate vessels for a safe and stable voyage.\nAddressing this conundrum led to a collaboration between the international cruise line Carnival and Intellian, the market-leading provider of stabilized satellite antenna systems. The upshot of this joint development was the creation of the unique 2.4m v240MT antenna system.\nSolutions\nMulti-Band, C-, Ku- and Ka- with Multi-Orbit auto switching antenna system, v240MT\nGEO & MEO Hybrid networks, enabled by the Multi-Orbit antenna system\nIntelligent Mediator to manage multiple antenna systems and airtime services efficiently\nA trailblazing initiative with the ability to auto-switch between three frequency ranges C-, Ku- and Ka-band, the v240MT can also track Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites.\nAfter an extensive period of joint development and testing, the v240MT systems were ready for installation. Blad Stavropoulos, a Senior Manager for Global Connectivity and System Engineering, Carnival Cruise Line, recalls, “The first of our ships to be equipped was the Regal Princess, from there, we installed more antennas across the Carnival Cruise Line and Holland America fleets, working hard to enable features which constantly increase the system’s performance, resiliency, and reliability.”\nAny discussion of installation begs the question of how much time and money is spent on actually fitting the system. “Installing the v240MT is extremely easy,” Stavropoulos confirms. “It comes pre-assembled in three crates, and you just have to put three major pieces together, the pedestal, reflector, and dome. My team can install the v240MT in a day-and-a-half. We have seen a 65% saving on additional costs, just because of the way the v240MT gets assembled.”\nThis reduction in installation time and expenditure was matched with simplified maintenance due to the fault-finding and remote support capabilities of the system’s inbuilt Spectrum Analyzer. Remote access and automated diagnostics are enabled by Intellian’s Aptus web interface; enabling onshore engineers to access their antennas through the onboard network.\nThe core of the v240MT system is the Intelligent Mediator which controls automatic switching between multiple antennas, networks, constellations, and frequency bands.\n“The multi-orbit capabilities which make the antennas vendor-agnostic have created a system that can connect to any service provider in any global region,” Stavropoulos enthuses regarding the Intelligent Mediator. Stavropoulos goes on to say, “Meanwhile, we use the multi-band approach for transitions between, for example, the North American region to Europe. Having a phenomenal satellite reacquire performance, the system goes from one band to the other in less than 40 seconds.”\nStavropoulos continues to praise the Intelligent Mediator’s capacity to support identical onboard Dual Data Centers. “On our vessels with three or more antennas, the Intelligent Mediator becomes a key player. Having data centers in two independent areas of a ship allows us to have a backup plan and also enables us to marry multiple antennas to a single system. On our ships with four antennas, we do that to create a blockage mitigation scenario; if one antenna is blocked by any part of the ship’s superstructure, another one isn’t, so there’s a seamless transition between the two.\"\n“That will be important when working with MEO constellations. With MEO, you utilize three antennas to behave as a single one. We are preparing our vessels to ingest MEO and LEO satellites in 2022 when the first one becomes available,” Stavropoulos states.\nWhen MEO and LEO services go live, Carnival aims to provide 1 to 2GB of capacity per vessel; a considerable boon when between 1,500 to 1,800 people can be active online at any one time on a cruise liner containing an average of 5,000 passengers/crew.\nBenefits\nAble to provide satisfactory internet service offerings to thousands of passengers and crew on board\nCarnival to introduce an enhanced onboard digital experience for increased guest satisfaction\nThe future-proof v240MT is equipped to set a high bar in maritime satellite communications, not merely for the cruise sector but also for other high-volume data users including offshore and seismic survey vessels. Its ground-breaking ability to operate across three orbits and three bands won the system Via Satellite’s inaugural Satellite Technology of the Year Award in 2018.\n“Even when sailing in the middle of the ocean, we can - and should - expect to experience the same levels of connectivity we enjoy on land. Carnival sets the gold standard for passengers. It’s a welcome confirmation that our partnership with Intellian has produced such a technological yardstick,” Stavropoulos concludes, “and indicates that the only way to keep our passengers and crew content and safe in an ever-evolving market is to keep looking ahead, driving improvements and refining the definitions of what constitutes the first-rate service.”\nDownloads\nPDF version\nIntellian Case Study Cruise Carnival\nDownload Latest\nRequest Information\nContact Us\nFor further detailed information on the Intellian products and solutions shown here, please submit your request using this convenient form.\nFind out more",

The Intellian GMDSS terminals will also support SSAS and LRIT, as well as the full range of Iridium Certus® standard services including voice and broadband data. Iridium GMDSS distress alerts are automatically routed to a Rescue Coordination Centre (RCC) based on the location of the vessel. Alternatively, a user may pre-select an RCC of their choice. Nearby vessels can also be alerted and called directly, enabling them to potentially offer faster assistance to those in distress.\nPlanned for Q4 2024, the GMDSS safety terminal will utilize the Iridium network which is supported by a unique constellation of 66 cross-linked L-band satellites in Low Earth Orbit. This network provides reliable coverage around the globe, including the entire Arctic and Antarctic areas, which only Iridium GMDSS serves. Users will have access to reliable and secure safety services even in the most extreme weather conditions while at sea.\nAdditional features for the GMDSS solution include Distress Alert Relay, Shore-to-Ship Distress Calling, Medical Assistance/Advice, and reporting of dangers or debris.\nEric Sung, CEO of Intellian Technologies Inc.,\nspeaking on today’s announcement said:\n“Traversing vast distances across our oceans, seafarers encounter numerous challenges. Anything from ship failures to medical emergencies to adverse weather conditions. The new Iridium GMDSS satellite safety terminals we’re developing are lifelines between ship and shore. We’re delighted to be expanding our Iridium portfolio and collaborating once again on fantastic new solutions. Iridium brings reliable and truly global GMDSS services to the market for the first time ever, making critical safety services available anywhere on the globe. It’s an exciting journey ahead, as we develop this GMDSS solution together and bring it to market next year.”\nWouter Deknopper, Vice-President and General Manager Maritime Business at Iridium said:\n“Today’s announcement of Intellian’s GMDSS safety terminal development is another fantastic chapter in our GMDSS journey and our ongoing efforts to improve maritime safety. Iridium's GMDSS service brings many new capabilities to the maritime industry. The combination of Iridium Certus, the fastest L-Band broadband service, with Iridium GMDSS and security services establishes a new standard in maritime communications technology. The new Intellian terminal delivering Iridium GMDSS services will ensure that even more seafarers will have peace of mind and that no matter their location, they’ll remain safe and connected.”\n###\nAbout Intellian Technologies, Inc.\nIntellian\nis driven by a passion for innovation and an agile responsiveness to customer needs.

  "page_92.txt": "Intellian Innovation - feature-rich, future-proof satellite communications and TV solutions | Intelliantech\nNetworks\nHybrid\nConnectivity\nNetworks\nOverview\nThe Future is Hybrid Connectivity\nLEO\nMEO\nGEO\nHEO\nMulti-band\nDifferent solutions for different needs\nOverview\nAs the crucial link between satellite networks and millions of people on Earth, Intellian’s leading technology and antennas empower global connectivity across oceans and continents, organizations, and communities.\nOur antennas are at the heart of the satellite communication network. They facilitate seamless data transmission, ensuring high-speed internet, television broadcasting, and secure communications for maritime, land, and mobility applications. Intellian's commitment to excellence means our antennas are built to withstand the most challenging environments, providing uninterrupted connectivity regardless of location.\nHow it all works and the role of Intellian in empowering connectivity.\nSATELLITES\nCommunication and TV broadcast satellites in space are owned and managed by network operators, to provide services back on earth. Satellite constellations are deployed in either low Earth orbit (LEO approx. 500 to 2,000 km high), medium Earth orbit (MEO approx. 2,000 to 35,785 km high), geostationary (GEO 35,786 km) or highly elliptical orbit (HEO – approx. 40,000 km at apogee).\nThe higher the orbit, the smaller the number of satellites required for global coverage.\nSatellite networks utilize different frequency bands of spectrum. The most commonly used are L-Band (1-2 GHz), C-Band (4-8 GHz), X-Band (8-12 GHz), Ku-Band (12-18 GHz) and Ka-Band (26.5-40 GHz). Each have their pros and cons, with network operators deciding on which frequency their network will utilize based on the customer needs.\nGROUND STATIONS\nGround stations are large fixed antennas, that transmit signals to the satellites, which then amplify and redirect these signals back to Intellian user terminals located on land or sea.\nFor a global network, ground stations are built around the world.\nLEO constellations need more ground stations than MEO or GEO because:\nTheir proximity to Earth results in a smaller coverage area per satellite.\nThey move rapidly across the sky, requiring frequent handovers between satellites and ground stations to maintain continuous coverage.\nLEO networks have large constellations of satellites, which in turn demands a denser network of ground stations to track and communicate with the satellites as they pass overhead.\nINTELLIAN TERMINALS\nIntellian is a global technology partner to more network operators than any other manufacturer: Eutelsat OneWeb, SES, Inmarsat, Iridium, Viasat and Telenor.\nIntellian's hardware enables satellite network connectivity. Hardware includes antennas, terminals, radomes, parabolic and flat panels, and below deck units.\nManufactured by Intellian, our products are designed to be installed by customers on a vessel, a building or vehicle to connect to the satellite to empower internet services.\nThe outdoor unit requires line of sight to the satellite, and an indoor or below deck unit which often houses the satellite modem and associated electronics, processing signals received from the outdoor unit, enables connectivity for end-users through terrestrial networks or devices.\nThe Future is Hybrid Connectivity\nIn today's rapidly evolving satcom landscape, hybrid connectivity has become essential. Intellian leads the way with the most diverse range of multi-orbit, multi-band products to help deliver unparalleled reliability and performance, allowing customers to leverage the strengths of various satellite networks anywhere in the world.\nEnhanced reliability through redundant connections\nOptimized performance by selecting the best available network signal or pricing\nIncreased coverage by accessing multiple satellite constellations\nImproved flexibility to meet diverse communication needs\nKu-band\nEUTELSAT ONEWEB SERIES\nFlat Panel Series:\nOW11FM | OW11FL | OW11FV | OW10HM | OW10HL |  OW10HV\nParabolic Series:\nOW50M | OW50M H | OW50SL | OW70M | OW70M H | OW70L P-S | OW70L P-P | OW70R | OW130L\nDiscover More\nL-Band\nIRIDIUM CERTUS SERIES\nC200M | C200L | C700 | C700 Winterized\nDiscover More\nPrevious\nNext\nEUTELSAT ONEWEB SERIES\nIRIDIUM CERTUS SERIES\n2.4M SERIES\nv240M 2 | v240MT 2 (kit)\nDiscover More\nBLOCK SERIES\nARC M4 Block 1 | v130NX PM Dual Ka\nDiscover More\nNX SERIES\nv85NX Ka (kit) | v130NX Ka (kit)\nDiscover More\nSES mPOWER SERIES\nmP85NX | mP130NX | mP240MT | mP85L | mP130L | mP240L\nDiscover More\nXEO SERIES\nX100D | X130D | X130D PM | X150D\nDiscover More\nPrevious\nNext\n2.4M SERIES\nBLOCK SERIES\nNX SERIES\nSES mPOWER SERIES\nXEO SERIES\n2.4M SERIES\nv240C | v240K | v240M 2 | v240MT 2\nDiscover More\nBLOCK SERIES\nARC M4 Block 1 | v130NX PM Dual Ka\nGovernment\nE-SERIES\nv60E | v80E | v100E\nDiscover More\nINMARSAT FB SERIES\nFLEET ONE | FB250 | FB500\nDiscover More\nINMARSAT GX SERIES\nGX60NX 2 | GX60NX 2 HP | GX60NX 2 ADS | GX60NX 2 ADS HP | GX100NX 2 | GX100NX 2 HP | GX100NX 2 ADS | GX100NX 2 ADS HP\nDiscover More\nNX SERIES\nv85NX | v100NX | v130NX | v150NX | v85NX Ka | v100NX Ka | v130NX Ka | v150NX Ka\nDiscover More\nXEO SERIES\nX100D | X130D | X130D PM | X150D\nDiscover More\nPrevious\nNext\n2.4M SERIES\nBLOCK SERIES\nE-SERIES\nINMARSAT FB SERIES\nINMARSAT GX SERIES\nNX SERIES\nXEO SERIES\nBLOCK SERIES\nARC M4 Block 1 | v130NX PM Dual Ka\nDiscover More\nINMARSAT GX SERIES\nGX60NX 2 | GX60NX 2 HP | GX60NX 2 ADS | GX60NX 2 ADS HP | GX100NX 2 | GX100NX 2 HP | GX100NX 2 ADS | GX100NX 2 ADS HP\nDiscover More\nPrevious\nNext\nBLOCK SERIES\nINMARSAT GX SERIES\nKey features\nC-BAND\n2.4M Series:\nv240C\nv240MT 2\nv240M 2\nKey features\nL-BAND\nInmarsat FB Series:\nFLEET ONE\nFB250\nFB500\nIridium Certus Series:\nC200M\nC200L\nC700\nC700 Winterized\nKey features\nKA-BAND\n2.4M Series\nInmarsat GX Series\nBlock Series\nNX Series\nSES mPower Series\nXEO Series\nKey features\nKU-BAND\n2.4M Series\nEutelsat OneWeb Series\nE-Series\nNX Series\nXEO Series\nKey features\nX-BAND\nBlock Series:\nARC M4 Block 1\nKey features\nMIL-KA\nBlock Series:\nARC M4 Block 1\nv130NX PM Dual Ka (Block 0)\nDifferent solutions for different needs\nWe are pioneering the future of satellite communication with our state-of-the-art antenna solutions.

Please\nbe sure there are no obstacles within 15º above the center of the antenna. Any\nobstacles can prevent the antenna from transmitting and receiving the satellite\nsignal.\nDo not install the antenna near the radar especially on the same plane, as its energy\nlevels may overload the antenna front-end circuits. It is recommended to position\nthe antenna at least 4 feet (1.2 m) above or below the level of the radar and minimum\nof 15 feet (4.6 m) away from the high power short wave radars.\nThe mounting platform should be rigid enough and not subjected to excessive\nvibration. The movement of the antenna can be minimized by installing at the\ncenter of the vessel. If these conditions can be only partially satisfied, find the best\ncompromised installation site between the various considerations.\n\nElevation limit\nof obstacles\n15°\n\nAntenna Unit\n\nObstacle\n\n21\n\n\fGX100 – Marine Satellite Communication System\n\nSetting block zones\nThe blockages around an antenna may interfere with the reception of the satellite\nsignal. Therefore, It is required to set a block zone which notifies users that antenna\ncannot receive satellite signal due to blockages. You can create five block zones\nby inputting azimuth and elevation value with ACU. When the antenna is within the\nblock zones, the ACU works as follows.\n1. “BLOCK” will be displayed on the ACU screen.\n2. Tracking continues as long as the signal level is greater than the predefined\nthreshold value. When the signal level drops below the threshold value the\nantenna will wait and then re-target the satellite you targeted last. The amount\nof time the antenna waits before entering search mode is called the \"Search\nWait Time\" and can be adjusted in the parameters settings. The antenna will\ncontinue to re-target the satellite until the satellite is re-acquired and tracking\ncan be resumed.\n3. A transmit inhibit output from the ACU will disable/mute the modem transmission.\nRF Hazard Precautions\nThe antenna is designed to be used with radiation transmit equipment manufactured\nby others. Exposure to RF radiation, including exposure associated with an improper\nuse of the transmit equipment, may be hazardous to persons close to the above\ndeck unit. Ensure safety of personnel who work on the system.\nDuring transmission, ensure to keep the minimum safety distance. The recommended\nminimum safety distance to the reflector on the focal line is about 25m, based on a\nradiation level of 5mW/ cm2 that applies under occupational/controlled environment.\nNo hazard exists >20° below the antenna’s mounting plane.\n\nSafe access from radiation hazard\n22\n\n\fINSTALLING THE ANTENNA\n\nSystem Cables\nBefore installing the system cables, you need to take the following points into\nconsideration.\n1. All cables need to be well clamped and protected from physical damage\nand exposure to heat and humidity.\n2. Cable with an acute bend is not allowed.\n3. Where a cable passes through an exposed bulkhead or deck head,\na watertight gland or swan neck tube should be used.\n• RF Cable (Customer Furnished)\n\nDue to the voltage losses across the length of the RF coax on L-Band, Intellian\nrecommends the following 50 ohm coax cable types for standard system\ninstallations.

The InstallShield Wizard will guide you through the\nprogram setup process. The installation routine provides an icon on the desktop.\n\nClick the icon to start the software. In addition, Intellian also provides patch files\nfor software upgrade.\n\n83\n\n\fGX100 – Marine Satellite Communication System\n\nPC to ACU Communication Setup\nStarting Aptus®\nDouble-click the Aptus® desktop icon. The Communication Window will appear\nto establish the data communication between your PC and the ACU. Select your\nchoice of connection method to access your ACU through either the Serial Port\nCommunication or the Network Communication (TCP/IP).\n\n84\n\n\fAptus®\n\nEstablish a data\ncommunication\n\nAccess ACU through Serial Communication\n1.\nConnect a 9 pin serial cable between the PC INTERFACE connector on\nthe ACU and the 9 pin serial port on the PC. (Or you can use a USB cable\nto setup serial connection between a PC and the USB port on the ACU.)\n2.\nSelect serial at communication type combo-box.\n3.\nThe baud rate of the ACU is 57600.\n4.\nSelect a COM port which is not occupied by other devices.\n5.\nClick the Connect button.\nAccess ACU through Network Communication (TCP/IP)\n1.\nTurn off the wireless connection while using this method.\n2.\nConnect your PC to the Management Port. (See 'PC to ACU Communication\nSetup' section for other network connection methods.)\n3.\nSelect Network at communication type combo-box.\n4.\nEnter in the ACU’s IP address (Factory default : 192.168.1.2)\n5.\nEnter in the ACU’s port number (Factory default : 4002)\n6.\nClick the Connect button then the Authentication window will appear.\n7.\nLogin by using the username and password below:\nUsername: intellian (Factory default)\nPassword: 12345678 (Factory default)\n\nNOTE: If the remote access PC is located in the same network group with the ACU,\nthe ACU can be accessed through the internal IP address. But, if the remote access\nPC is located outside of the network group, the ACU’s IP address should be changed\nto the IP address assigned by the network service provider.\n\nWARNING:\n- Do not plug a USB to the ACU while TCP/IP communication is in use.\nDoing so will disable current PC Software Control because the USB\nconnection has higher priority than TCP/IP connection.\n- The amount of data will increase rapidly if Network Communication is in use.\nIntellian recommends using Aptus Web.\n\n85\n\n\fGX100 – Marine Satellite Communication System\n\nAutoUpdate\nIntellian Aptus® checks and notifies the latest version when it is started to maintain\nup to date software version by AutoUpdate function.\n\n1.
