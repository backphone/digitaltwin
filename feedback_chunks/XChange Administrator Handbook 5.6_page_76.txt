4.7.6  VPN  
The embedded VPN client supports connection to shore -based ‘Open VPN’ and ‘GRE VPN’ servers. The 
VPN client can be enabled and set up for any communication channel and broadband terminal 
individually.  
This provides fully flexible configuration capabilities. It is possible to link the whole vessel data 
communication to the onshore VPN server, or just one User group such as machines or corporate 
traffic.  
The VPN channel can be defined as one -way (XChange > shore) or two -way (XChange <> shore) 
communication.  
The two -way option provides remote access to on -board network clients linked to the VPN channel.
