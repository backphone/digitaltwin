Key Features
Frequency & Orbit Agnostic Capabilities
The Intellian v240MT 2 solution provides the unique capability of switching among different satellite frequency bands and satellite orbits as required without any user intervention
True 2.4m Multi-band RF Performance
The v240MT 2 provides unsurpassed seamless operation for vessels in cruise and energy industries requiring increased bandwidth, wider coverage, and greater reliability.
Fiber Optic Solution
The Fiber optic solution, based on our extensive fiber optic experience, results in minimal signal loss regardless of interconnecting cable length. It enables greater bandwidth capability compared to a coaxial cable connection between an ADU and BDU. The Fiber optic solution is a significant benefit for high throughput installations and allows for quicker and more flexible installation solutions.
The Intelligent Mediator
This incredibly sophisticated and flexible system allows for automatic switching between networks, satellites, orbits, and importantly, provides support for Dual Data Centers. All of this happens automatically, without any user intervention, to ensure data integrity and no dropped calls.

RF Switching between multiple modems
Mediator for redundant antenna system
Smart handover for NGSO satellite tracking
MEO/GEO hybrid operation
Multi-Antenna Operation with Dual Data Centers
Supporting Dual Data Centers on a ship ensures uninterrupted connectivity. The identical mirrored systems, including a full complement of antenna controllers, Intelligent Mediators and satellite modems, can handle instant changeover with no manual intervention, an important factor in crew safety and vessel operations.
Provide system redundancy of the satellite networks
Automated instant changeover with no manual intervention
Up to 3x antennas connectable via Intelligent Mediator IM3
Up to 8x antennas and 8 modems connected using the Intelligent Mediator IM8
The benefits of a 2.4m satellite communication solution
Staying connected at sea is important for Crew and Guests, the v240MT provides the level of connectivity you might expect when onshore. Allowing enterprise apps and business applications to run the operations of the vessel, while still being able to provide for crew and guest welfare.
