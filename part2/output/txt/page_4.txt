Key Features
Optimized Performance
Utilizing Intellian’s innovative antenna design, the OW10HL delivers high performance in a compact form factor. The small size combined with low power consumption deliver the ideal connectivity solution for use cases that are SWaP constrained but still require the high-speed connectivity provided by the OneWeb network.
Seamless Connectivity
The OW10HL features Intellian’s advanced tracking technology improving connection reliability and availability, even on heavy seas and at the lowest elevation angles encountered in equatorial regions.
Ensuring minimal loss over scan, the innovative flat panel technology facilitates smooth reliable handovers, which ensure seamless and undisrupted connectivity.
Extreme Temperature Performance
The OW10HL is designed to ensure dependable performance in even the most demanding environments, operating in extremely low temperatures down to -40 °C and up to +55 °C (-40 °F to +131 °F),
delivering reliable broadband services for customers situated in the most remote locations.
Simplified Installation
Lightweight and sleek design with a single coaxial cable for both power and encrypted data, connects the UT to the CNX. Embedded differential dual GNSS antennas enable automated True North calibration and Tilt Error compensation.
Customer Network Exchange
Intellian’s Customer Network Exchange (CNX) units are a critical component of the user terminal installation, providing both the power and data connectivity to the Flat Panel, and the connectivity to customer equipment and networks. For Compact Flat Panels there are four CNX variants offered for specific deployments: CNX-BB, CNX-WIFI, CNX-RACK and CNX-MOBILITY.

Easily Deployable System
The lightweight design and compact form factor enables easy installation by a single person. Designed for use with standard off-the-shelf mounting solutions, the OW10HL can be deployed in a variety of locations to suit the application and environment. Installation is further simplified through use of combined power and data over a single coax cable connecting the indoor and outdoor units. The use of Intellian’s mobile app for site survey, automated configuration, and monitoring further reduces the time required to get online.
