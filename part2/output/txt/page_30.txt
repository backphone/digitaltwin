Key Features
GEO/MEO/LEO tracking capability
Based on Intellian proven antenna design and multi-orbit GEO, MEO, and LEO tracking capabilities, the X100D can operate on any commercial Ku-band and Ka-band (2.5 GHz wide Ka-band coverage) services, enabling access to the highest bandwidth packages worldwide. Optimized to deliver low latency and high speed connectivity, the terminal will allow customers the flexibility to access next-generation LEO services and existing GEO and MEO constellations.
Antenna management platform
AptusNX, provides a responsive web user interface to manage and control the antenna system regardless of device type. AptusNX includes an intelligent installation wizard to simplify system configuration so that users can become connected faster than ever before. The platform also includes a diagnostic function that enables accurate and enhanced antenna performance checks both onboard and remotely. This reduces the need for onboard service personnel and improves performance.
All-in-One below deck terminal
Only Intellian provides a below deck terminal fully integrated into a single 1U, 19” rack module, reducing installation time & cost. Antenna mediator and modem mediator included.
