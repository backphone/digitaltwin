Overview
As the crucial link between satellite networks and millions of people on Earth, Intellian’s leading technology and antennas empower global connectivity across oceans and continents, organizations, and communities.
Our antennas are at the heart of the satellite communication network. They facilitate seamless data transmission, ensuring high-speed internet, television broadcasting, and secure communications for maritime, land, and mobility applications. Intellian's commitment to excellence means our antennas are built to withstand the most challenging environments, providing uninterrupted connectivity regardless of location.
How it all works and the role of Intellian in empowering connectivity.
SATELLITES
Communication and TV broadcast satellites in space are owned and managed by network operators, to provide services back on earth. Satellite constellations are deployed in either low Earth orbit (LEO approx. 500 to 2,000 km high), medium Earth orbit (MEO approx. 2,000 to 35,785 km high), geostationary (GEO 35,786 km) or highly elliptical orbit (HEO – approx. 40,000 km at apogee).
The higher the orbit, the smaller the number of satellites required for global coverage.
Satellite networks utilize different frequency bands of spectrum. The most commonly used are L-Band (1-2 GHz), C-Band (4-8 GHz), X-Band (8-12 GHz), Ku-Band (12-18 GHz) and Ka-Band (26.5-40 GHz). Each have their pros and cons, with network operators deciding on which frequency their network will utilize based on the customer needs.
GROUND STATIONS
Ground stations are large fixed antennas, that transmit signals to the satellites, which then amplify and redirect these signals back to Intellian user terminals located on land or sea.
For a global network, ground stations are built around the world.
LEO constellations need more ground stations than MEO or GEO because:
Their proximity to Earth results in a smaller coverage area per satellite.
They move rapidly across the sky, requiring frequent handovers between satellites and ground stations to maintain continuous coverage.
LEO networks have large constellations of satellites, which in turn demands a denser network of ground stations to track and communicate with the satellites as they pass overhead.
INTELLIAN TERMINALS
Intellian is a global technology partner to more network operators than any other manufacturer: Eutelsat OneWeb, SES, Inmarsat, Iridium, Viasat and Telenor.
Intellian's hardware enables satellite network connectivity. Hardware includes antennas, terminals, radomes, parabolic and flat panels, and below deck units.
Manufactured by Intellian, our products are designed to be installed by customers on a vessel, a building or vehicle to connect to the satellite to empower internet services.
The outdoor unit requires line of sight to the satellite, and an indoor or below deck unit which often houses the satellite modem and associated electronics, processing signals received from the outdoor unit, enables connectivity for end-users through terrestrial networks or devices.
The Future is Hybrid Connectivity
In today's rapidly evolving satcom landscape, hybrid connectivity has become essential. Intellian leads the way with the most diverse range of multi-orbit, multi-band products to help deliver unparalleled reliability and performance, allowing customers to leverage the strengths of various satellite networks anywhere in the world.
Enhanced reliability through redundant connections
Optimized performance by selecting the best available network signal or pricing
Increased coverage by accessing multiple satellite constellations
Improved flexibility to meet diverse communication needs

Different solutions for different needs
We are pioneering the future of satellite communication with our state-of-the-art antenna solutions. All our antennas are designed in one of two ways – an ‘open network’ or a ‘closed network’ design.
An open network antenna design offers flexibility and interoperability across multiple satellite networks and operators. These systems are built to support a variety of configurations and frequencies, making them versatile and widely applicable.

A closed network antenna design is tailored for use within a specific, often proprietary network. These systems are typically optimized for a single operator or service provider, with tight integration and specific configuration settings that align with the operator’s network requirements.
We collaborate closely with more network operators than any other manufacturer to provide seamless, reliable, and high-speed connectivity for their customers across the globe.
