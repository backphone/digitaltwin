Viewing the Default Configuration
When you first boot up your Cisco router, some basic configuration has already been performed. All of
the LAN and WAN interfaces have been created, console and VTY ports are configured, and the inside
interface for Network Address Translation has been assigned. Use the show running-config command
to view the initial configuration, as shown in Example 1.

Note

If you are unable to view the initial configuration and you get a No Password Set error message, you
must reset the initial password. For details, see the “Recovering a Lost Password” section in Chapter 14,
“Troubleshooting”.

Information Needed for Configuration
You need to gather some or all of the following information, depending on your planned network
scenario, prior to configuring your network
•

If you are setting up an Internet connection, gather the following information:
– Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) client name that is assigned as your login name
– PPP authentication type: Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) or Password

Authentication Protocol (PAP)
– PPP password to access your Internet service provider (ISP) account
– DNS server IP address and default gateways
•

If you are setting up a connection to a corporate network, you and the network administrator must
generate and share the following information for the WAN interfaces of the routers:
– PPP authentication type: CHAP or PAP
– PPP client name to access the router
– PPP password to access the router

•

If you are setting up IP routing:
– Generate the addressing scheme for your IP network.
– Determine the IP routing parameter information, including IP address, and ATM permanent

virtual circuits (PVCs). These PVC parameters are typically virtual path identifier (VPI), virtual
circuit identifier (VCI), and traffic shaping parameters.
– Determine the number of PVCs that your service provider has given you, along with their VPIs

and VCIs.
– For each PVC determine the type of AAL5 encapsulation supported. It can be one of the

following:

Cisco 1800 Series Integrated Services Routers (Fixed) Software Configuration Guide

OL-6426-02

Chapter 1

Basic Router Configuration
Configuring Basic Parameters

AAL5SNAP—This can be either routed RFC 1483 or bridged RFC 1483. For routed RFC 1483,
the service provider must provide you with a static IP address. For bridged RFC 1483, you may
use DHCP to obtain your IP address, or you may obtain a static IP address from your service
provider.
AAL5MUX PPP—With this type of encapsulation, you need to determine the PPP-related
configuration items.
•

If you plan to connect over an ADSL or G.SHDSL line:
– Order the appropriate line from your public telephone service provider.

For ADSL lines—Ensure that the ADSL signaling type is DMT (also called ANSI T1.413) or
DMT Issue 2.
For G.SHDSL lines—Verify that the G.SHDSL line conforms to the ITU G.991.2 standard and
supports Annex A (North America) or Annex B (Europe).
Once you have collected the appropriate information, you can perform a full configuration on
your router, beginning with the tasks in the “Configuring Basic Parameters” section.

Configuring Basic Parameters
To configure the router, perform one or more of these tasks:
•

Configure Global Parameters

•

Configure Fast Ethernet LAN Interfaces

•

Configure WAN Interfaces

•

Configuring a Loopback Interface

•

Configuring Command-Line Access to the Router

A configuration example is presented with each task to show the network configuration following
completion of that task.

Configuring Static Routes
Static routes provide fixed routing paths through the network. They are manually configured on the
router. If the network topology changes, the static route must be updated with a new route. Static routes
are private routes, unless they are redistributed by a routing protocol. Configuring static routes on the
Cisco 1800 series routers is optional.
Perform these steps to configure static routes, beginning in global configuration mode:

Step 1

Command

Purpose

ip route prefix mask {ip-address | interface-type
interface-number [ip-address]}

Specifies the static route for the IP packets.

Example:
Router(config)# ip route 192.168.1.0
255.255.0.0 10.10.10.2
Router(config)#

Step 2

end

For details about this command and additional
parameters that can be set, see the Cisco IOS IP
Command Reference, Volume 2 of 4: Routing
Protocols.

Exits router configuration mode, and enters
privileged EXEC mode.

Example:
Router(config)# end
Router#

For complete information on the static routing commands, see the Cisco IOS Release 12.3
documentation set. For more general information on static routing, see Appendix B, “Concepts.”

Basic Router Configuration
Configuring Dynamic Routes

Configuration Example
In the following configuration example, the static route sends out all IP packets with a destination IP
address of 192.168.1.0 and a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 on the Fast Ethernet interface to another
device with an IP address of 10.10.10.2. Specifically, the packets are sent to the configured PVC.
You do not need to enter the commands marked “(default).” These commands appear automatically in
the configuration file generated when you use the show running-config command.
!
ip classless (default)
ip route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2!

Verifying Your Configuration
To verify that you have properly configured static routing, enter the show ip route command and look
for static routes signified by the “S.”
You should see verification output similar to the following example.
Router# show ip route

Configuring Dynamic Routes
In dynamic routing, the network protocol adjusts the path automatically, based on network traffic or
topology. Changes in dynamic routes are shared with other routers in the network.
The Cisco routers can use IP routing protocols, such as Routing Information Protocol (RIP) or Enhanced
Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), to learn routes dynamically. You can configure either of
these routing protocols on your router.
