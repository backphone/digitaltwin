2.     Turn the antenna in AZ with hands and find the home switch and the bracket (see attached picture) and visually check if they are not loose. Make sure that cable for the home sensor is connected properly to the cable interface box.
3.     Switch on the antenna and observe the antenna initialization. Last initialization step is AZ initialization. Antenna will turn in AZ until the home sensor meets the metal bracket. The sensor includes the LED light, this LED should turn ON when the metal is being detected. Is this LED light turning on?
