Key Features
Optimized Performance
Utilizing Intellian’s innovative antenna design, the OW10HV delivers optimal performance in a compact form factor making it the ideal connectivity solution for use cases that are SWaP constrained. The resulting solution provides the user experience and service levels that customers expect.
Seamless Connectivity
The OW10HV features Intellian’s advanced tracking technology improving connection reliability and availability, even on heavy seas and at the lowest elevation angles encountered in equatorial regions.
Ensuring minimal loss over scan, the innovative flat panel technology facilitates smooth reliable handovers, which ensure seamless and undisrupted connectivity.
Harsh Environment Performance
The OW10HV is designed to ensure dependable performance in even the most demanding environments, operating in extremely low temperatures down to -40 °C and up to +55 °C (-40 °F to 131 °F). Integrated radar rejection filtering ensures performance in high interference installations and reliable broadband services for customers situated in the most remote locations.
Simplified Installation
Lightweight and sleek design with a single coaxial cable for both power and encrypted data, connects the UT to the CNX. Embedded differential dual GNSS antennas enable automated True North calibration and Tilt Error compensation.
Customer Network Exchange
Intellian’s Customer Network Exchange (CNX) units are a critical component of the user terminal installation, providing both the power and data connectivity to the Flat Panel, and the connectivity to customer equipment and networks. For Compact Flat Panels there are four CNX variants offered for specific deployments: CNX-BB, CNX-WIFI, CNX-RACK and CNX-MOBILITY.
