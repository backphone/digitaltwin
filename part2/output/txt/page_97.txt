Intellian ARC - M4 B1 - Mil-Spec VSAT | Intelliantech
ARC-M4 Block 1
Simultaneous X/Ka Band Wideband VSAT System with 3-axis precision positioner and a 1.3m Reflector
The ARC-M4 Block enables agile resilient communications (ARC) multi-role, multi-mission, multi-band, and multi-arc (M4). Block 1 delivers dual, simultaneous links in both X-band and Ka-band, providing communication path redundancy and fallback options for the Warfighter. Pathway diversity coupled with intelligent mediation and link bonding delivers unparalleled resiliency in a single user terminal. Block 1 promotes interoperability between major satellite operators, namely Wideband Global SATCOM (WGS), Inmarsat I5, and SES mPOWER.

Key Features
MEO/LEO/HEO tracking capability
The ARC-M4 Block 1 provides assured access to every SATCOM arc of interest, including MEO, LEO and HEO. The ARC-M4 Block 1 can access current and future GSO/NGSO constellations in X and Ka-Band The ARC-M4 Block 1 increases the overall resiliency of communications by supporting dynamic switching between multiple frequencies and alternative orbits.
Design for resiliency
The ARC-M4 Block 1 is designed to work with other commercial Ka-band service providers, this antenna opens up a new, broader set of connectivity options than the Navy has ever had before. This terminal is designed to meet the MILSTD ruggedization requirements of the US Navy.
Electronic band switching
All frequency band changes are electronic, not mechanical The ARC-M4 Block 1 is designed and engineered to operate on both X and Military Ka-Bands simultaneously, without the need to replace the reflector and feed assembly. The system is supplied with X and 3 5 GHz Wideband Ka-Band RF packages.
Support for the Warfighter
Intellian built and is currently delivering the AN/OE 4706 COTS terminal. Like all of our systems for the US Government, it combines MIL STD rugged designs with innovation, elegant implementation and COTS sensibilities.
Resilience for the Warfighter
This system supports single, dual, triple or even up to eight terminal installations. Shipboard blockage zones, sea state conditions or other conditions are dealt with automatically. Up to eight modems or waveforms can be automatically switched in and out. And these Intellian systems support the policy-driven shipboard automation system we call Intellian Orchestra ™.
3.5GHz Wide Ka-band optimized
The ARC-M4 Block 1 is optimized to operate in the full Commercial and Military Ka-Band spectrums. The ARC-M4 Block 1 supports the current Commercial Ka-Band GEO/MEO constellations and Military Ka-Band GEO constellations as well as upcoming GSO/NGSO Ka-Band constellations.
