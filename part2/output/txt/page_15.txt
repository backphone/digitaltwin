Key Features
High Speed Connectivity
The OW130L delivers fast and responsive communication services to customers in land. Equipped with a 125 cm reflector and capable of achieving data speeds reaching up to 195 Mbps for downlink and 32 Mbps for uplink. The OW130L facilitates high-speed applications for extensive enterprises, large rural community broadband, and onshore smart energy initiatives.
Seamless Connectivity
The OW130L is comprises of two antennas which operate in Primary-Secondary mode. The terminal's 3 axis stabilization platform allows seamless and undisrupted connectivity, which is essential for smooth reliable handovers.
Low temperature performance
Utilizing the latest heating device technology, the OW130L provides dependable performance in extremely low temperatures (-40 degrees Celsius). With Eutelsat OneWeb being the only LEO constellation committing to 100% coverage of the poles, you can be assured of affordable and reliable broadband services for communities and businesses in regions of remote connectivity including in polar regions.
Eutelsat OneWeb LEO constellation
Eutelsat OneWeb supplies high-speed internet connectivity to every corner of the world, even in the most remote location. Utilizing its 648 LEO satellite constellation, Eutelsat OneWeb is able to deliver high-speed low latency connectivity.
LEO satellite scan and tracking algorithm
The OW130L is comprised of two antennas which operate in Primary-Secondary mode. Designed specifically to prevent the keyhole effect, the OW130L ensures a reliable connection even when the satellite is directly overhead.
18.2 dB/K antennas with 3 axis stabilization
3 axis stabilization allows easy tracking of LEO satellites
A responsive cross-level beam helps to point the antenna in the right direction even when the elevation angle approaches Â±82 degrees
'Keyhole problem' avoidance design is implemented in the OW130L which in turn enables the antenna to continue tracking normally even when the satellite is directly overhead
