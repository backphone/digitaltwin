Overview
A whole new world of low profile, high performance LEO connectivity
Intellian’s Flat Panel Series is a suite of Enterprise and Compact user terminals, designed for Eutelsat OneWeb's LEO network. They deliver exceptional performance in sleek, small-footprint, and lightweight form factors. Designed for Land Fixed, Land Mobile and Government markets, they’re a game-changer for customers globally requiring low profile, easy installation, high performance, and high availability connectivity.
Product range
Intellian’s Flat Panel Series consists of two variants – Compact and Enterprise – with two models of each available for Land Fixed (OW10HL and OW11FL) and Land Mobility (OW10HV and OW11FV) giving customers the biggest choice of flat panels to address their specific market needs and use cases.
The Compact Flat Panels deliver unprecedented throughputs in an optimized for Size, Weight and Power design. The small size combined with low power consumption delivers the ideal connectivity solution for use cases that are SWaP constrained but still require the high-speed connectivity provided by the Eutelsat OneWeb LEO network.
Our Enterprise Flat Panels are designed to deliver high reliability and performance for business-critical communications. ​ Utilizing Intellian’s innovative antenna design, they deliver the maximum throughput allowed on the Eutelsat OneWeb LEO network. Offering the highest link margin, performance is guaranteed even over scan and at the lowest elevation angles, ensuring the highest levels of service is delivered.

Key Features
Designed exclusively for use on Eutelsat OneWeb’s LEO network, they are meticulously engineered to meet the unique demands of end users ensuring fast, reliable connectivity everywhere in the world for both land fixed and land mobility markets, including polar regions.
Efficient Array Design
Intellian’s active electronically scanned arrays (AESA) are a core component of the Flat Panel Series. Based on a proprietary antenna element design and custom vector-amplifier phased array chipset, the array is able to precisely control the antenna beams by electronically varying phase and amplitude parameters.
Our proprietary array design and software algorithms enable the delivery of the most efficient, highest-performing, and cost-effective flat panels available in the market.
Superior performance over scan
Intellian’s innovative antenna element and unit cell design, unique PCB board stack-up, and fabrication process result in lower scan loss with wider scan range.
Lower scan loss provides higher G/T and higher EIRP at scan, maintaining high throughput. Wider field-of-view scan range allows our Flat Panel Series to remain in network, even in the most severe platform motion.
Lightning speed handovers
Designed to support the frequent beam and satellite handovers required for operation on Eutelsat OneWeb's LEO network, Intellian’s flat panel architecture supports highly accurate beam pointing and ultra-fast, sub 350 micro-second satellite handovers. This rapid handover maintains the data connection during handover, resulting in an exceptional customer experience.
Optimized installation
The lightweight design and sleek form factor enables easy installation by a single person. Designed for
use with standard off-the-shelf mounting solutions, the Flat Panel Series can be deployed in a variety of locations to suit the application and environment. Installation is further simplified through use of combined power and data over a single coax cable connecting the indoor and outdoor units. The use of Intellian’s mobile app for site survey, automated configuration, and monitoring further reduces the time required to get online.
Smart blockage mitigation
During a dual installation for land fixed markets, the installer can configure the user terminals to store the location of known obstructions, which cause block zones. When live, advanced software algorithms then coordinate between the two flat panels, which operate as a single logical terminal to ensure connectivity to the satellite, knowing the location of these block zones and avoiding them.
