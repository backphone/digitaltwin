Key Features
GEO/MEO/LEO/HEO tracking
The v130NX PM Dual-Ka is ready for upcoming satellite constellations. Built on the field proven NX series, the v130NX PM Dual-Ka is designed with a robust satellite tracking algorithm that not only covers GEO, but also has tracking capabilities for emerging MEO, LEO, and HEO constellations. The v130NX PM increases the overall resiliency of naval communications by supporting current and future GSO and NGSO and dynamic switching between alternative orbits.
Design for resiliency
The v130NX PM Dual-Ka terminal is also WGS certified for multi-carrier operations, enabling additional carriers/waveforms for flexible mission planning. The v130NX PM Dual-Ka opens up a new, border set of resilient connectivity options for major allied navies worldwide.
Robust by design
The v130NX PM Dual-Ka is designed for use in military applications and meets or exceeds required specifications, not limited to MIL-STD-167-1A, MIL-STD-810H and MIL-STD-416G. The v130NX Dual-Ka is able to operate and survive in the harshest sea environments, providing reliable and uninterrupted communications.
Designed for sailors
Built on the field tested and market-proven NX series, the v130NX PM Dual-Ka terminal features the AptusNX antenna management and control system. The terminal provides an industry-leading, easy-to-use, intuitive interface delivering efficiency in configuration and maintenance.
Layers of resiliency
This system supports single, dual, triple or even up to eight terminal installations. Shipboard blockage zones, sea state conditions or other conditions are dealt with automatically. Up to eight modems or waveforms can be automatically switched in and out. And these Intellian systems support the policy-driven shipboard automation system we call Intellian Orchestra ™.
2GHz Wide Ka-Band optimized
The v130NX PM Dual Ka terminal supports both Military and Commercial Ka-Band services, assuring resiliency and diversity anywhere in the world. In combination with automatic switching between the two, this provides the sailor with additional resiliency for the respective missions.
