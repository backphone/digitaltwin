I just noticed that you have bad configuration in Intellian PC Controller regarding GPS settings. Please check proper configuration in attachment 1. Then kindly login to Intellian PC Controller - in the left side click on Setup -> antenna will go to setup mode (see setup-restart.jpg) - then check modem configuration in Connection Information tab, by "Use Mediator" tick "NO" - in the "Select Modem" scrollbar choose "IDIRECT-OPEN AMIP" (see 3rd.jpg attached) - click to restart -> it will get antenna from setup mode (see setup-restart.jpg)
