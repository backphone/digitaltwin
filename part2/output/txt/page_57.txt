Intelligent Mediator
Advanced antenna management solutions provide greater connectivity options with increased flexibility.
The IM8 T2 has increased the connectivity and configuration possibilities available to the operator. Providing VSAT Antenna Mediation for up to 8x antennas, enabling an improved smart approach to blockage mitigation, connection resiliency, antenna diversity and failure reduction.
The mediator functionality allows for modems to be dynamically assigned to different ports of the switch matrix without any physical changes in the RF infrastructure. The modem aggregation functionality supports the dynamic allocation of modems to an antenna. Which results in a significant increase of data capacity through a multi-carrier configuration.
The Intelligent Mediator IM8 T2 supports modems for GEO and MEO constellations covering various frequencies in C-, Ku- and Ka-band. The switching logic is rule- and priority-based and can easily be configured by the user in the mediator dashboard.
Intelligent Mediator IM8 T2
The Intelligent Mediator IM8 T2 allows the user to manage up to eight antennas and eight modems regardless of antenna brand, satellite orbit or frequency band. An intelligent system for blockage mitigation, antenna and modem redundancy and efficient satellite bandwidth utilization. The modem and antenna configuration is visualized in an easy-to-navigate dashboard. The Intelligent Mediator IM8 T2 is Orchestra (Advanced Antenna Management) ready, and the Automated Mediation and Asset Management service will be served with MES (Shipboard Mediation Edge Server) and CMS (Shore-side Cloud Service).
Make before break handover
The Intelligent Mediator IM8 T2 facilitates seamless handover between the rising and falling satellites in a MEO constellation. In addition, the Intelligent Mediator IM8 T2 can handle smooth antenna switch-overs on mid-trajectory satellites passes.
Active-Active dual data center mediation
In Active-Active mode services are split between data centers. This avoids a complete service outage in the event of a data center failure. Following a data center outage, the service is quickly restored since the antenna and modem configuration is synchronized between data centers every 5 seconds.
Multi-band and multi-mode operation
The Intelligent Mediator supports multiple operation modes to optimize bandwidth usage for a variety of GEO, MEO / GEO, Hybrid NGSO / GSO use case scenarios.
