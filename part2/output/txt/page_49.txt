Iridium Certus C700
The Intellian C700 maritime satellite terminal connects to the Iridium Certus network of 66 Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, providing pole-to-pole communication.
The Intellian C700 uses the most powerful 12 patch phased-array antenna to deliver the highest performing and most reliable Certus® terminal, especially at low angles of elevation, which is critical in a maritime environment. The winterized C700 terminal is designed to withstand extreme low temperature environments, while maintaining its high end performance. It allows the terminal to operate in harsh weather conditions like the polar regions.

Overview
Intellian C700 Certus
®
Terminal
Stay connected with the most powerful Iridium Certus terminal available.
The Intellian C700 maritime satellite terminal utilizes the Iridium Certus network of 66 Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites, providing pole-to-pole communication.
With its best-in-class RF performance, the C700 can deliver out-of-the-box uplink speeds of 352 Kbps and downlink speeds of 704 Kbps, with equally impressive low-elevation-angle RF efficiency thanks to its unique 12-patch phased array antenna design. It will support three high-quality, low-latency phone lines simultaneously; and as a solid-state antenna with no moving parts inside, the C700 is especially robust, requiring no scheduled maintenance over its lifetime.
