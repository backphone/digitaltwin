One of a Kind
53.5cm (21 inch) Reflector Ku-band Satellite TV System
The i5 Satellite TV system is the world's first marine satellite antenna system purpose built for offshore cruising vessels 12m (35ft) to 18m (60ft) in length. With performance similar to most 60cm (24 inch) systems, the i5 delivers quality signal reception throughout many of the world's popular cruising destinations in a small, efficient form factor that matches the aesthetic of vessels in this size class.

Key Features
Standard All Americas Package
i5 is standard equipped with All Americas LNB for extended cruising without swapping components along the way.
New Size Category
Only 21” system on the market today which performs like most 24” systems currently offered.
Triple Sat Function
Auto satellite switching function for three satellites.
Automatic Skew Control
The available i5P version is equipped with Automatic Skew Control, which allows for better satellite tracking on vessels operating over greater distances in regions served by Linear satellite transmissions.
iQ²: Quick&Quiet℠ Technology
iQ² Technology allows you to tune in quickly, maintain a solid signal lock, and enjoy your favorite TV programming in quiet comfort when alongside or out at sea
The Wide Range Search (WRS) Algorithm locks onto the satellite signal 4-5 times faster than conventional approaches
Dynamic Beam Tilting (DBT) technology uses intelligent, real-time beam analysis to ensure superior signal quality while reducing overall motor motion by up to 80%, eliminating intrusive background noise
Multiple Receiver Capability
Multiple receivers and TVs can be connected using a Multi-Switch or the Intellian MIM (Multi-Satellite Interface Module)
Using the MIM a master receiver can be selected to control the target satellite
In North America, when using Dish or Bell TV, a MIM is required, enabling automatic satellite switching from your remote control just like at home
