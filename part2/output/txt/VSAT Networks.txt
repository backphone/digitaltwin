Preface
Satellites for communication services have evolved quite signiﬁcantly in size and power since the launch of the ﬁrst commercial
satellites in 1965. This has permitted a consequent reduction in
the size of earth stations, and hence their cost, with a consequent
increase in number. Small stations, with antennas in the order of
1.2–1.8 rn, have become very popular under the acronym VSAT,
which stands for ’Very Small Aperture Terminals’. Such stations
can easily be installed at the customer’s premises and, considering
the inherent capability of a satellite to collect and broadcast signals
over large areas, are being widely used to support a large range of
services. Examples are broadcast and distribution services for data,
image, audio and video, collection and monitoring for data, image
and video, two-way interactive services for computer transactions,
data base inquiry, internet access and voice communications.
The trend towards deregulation, which started in the United
States, and progressed in other regions of the world, has triggered
the success of VSAT networks for corporate applications. This
illustrates that technology is not the only key to success. Indeed,
VSAT networks have been installed and operated only in those
regions of the world where demand existed for the kind of services
that VSAT technology could support in a cost effective way, and
also where the regulatory framework was supportive.
This book on VSAT networks aims at introducing the reader to
the important issues of services, economics and regulatory aspects.
It is also intended to give detailed technical insight on networking
and radiofrequency link aspects, therefore addressing the speciﬁc
features of VSAT networks at the three lower layers of the OSI
Reference Layer Model for data communications.

PREFACE

From my experience in teaching, I felt I should proceed from the
general to the particular. Therefore, Chapter 1 can be considered
as an introduction to the subject, with rather descriptive contents
on VSAT network conﬁgurations, services, operational and regulatory aspects. The more intrigued reader can then explore the
subsequent chapters.
Chapter 2 deals with those aspects of satellite orbit and technology
which inﬂuence the operation and performance of VSAT networks.
Chapter 3 details the operational aspects which are important
to the customer. Installation problems are presented, and a list
of potential concerns to the customer is explored. Hopefully, this
chapter will not be perceived as discouraging, but on the contrary
as a friendly guide for avoiding misfortunes, and getting the best
from a VSAT network.
The next two chapters are for technique oriented readers. Actually,
I thought this would be a piece of cake for my students, and a
reference text for network design engineers.
Chapter 4 deals with networking. It introduces trafﬁc characterisation, and discusses network and link layers protocols of the OSI
Reference Layer Model, as used in VSAT networks. It also presents
simple analysis tools for the dimensioning of VSAT networks from
trafﬁc demand and user speciﬁcations in terms of blocking probability and response time.
Chapter 5 covers the physical layer, providing the basic radio frequency link analysis, and presenting the parameters that condition
link quality and availability. An important aspect discussed here is
interference, as a result of the small size of the VSAT antenna, and
its related large beamwidth.
Appendices are provided for the beneﬁt of those readers who may
lack some background and have no time or opportunity to refer to
other sources.
The second edition of this book takes into account my experience while using the ﬁrst edition as a support for my lectures. It
incorporates some theoretical developments that were missing in
the ﬁrst edition, which constitute useful tools for the dimensioning
and the performance evaluation of VSAT networks. In particular,
Chapter 4 provides a more detailed treatment on how to evaluate
blocking probability and expands on the information transfer delay
analysis of the ﬁrst edition. This second edition also underplays the
regulatory aspects, as during the seven year interval between this
second edition and the ﬁrst, many administrations have simpliﬁed
and harmonised their regulatory framework. I felt this topic was not
perhaps as important as it used to be.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the students I have
taught, at the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Télécommunications,
the University of Surrey, CEI-Europe and other places, who, by
raising questions, asking for details and bringing in their comments,
have helped me to organise the material presented here.

Introduction
This chapter aims to provide the framework of VSAT technology
in the evolving context of satellite communications in terms of
network conﬁguration, services, economics, operational and regulatory aspects. It can also be considered by the reader as a guide
to the following chapters which aim to provide more details on
speciﬁc issues.

1.1

VSAT NETWORK DEFINITION

VSAT, now a well established acronym for Very Small Aperture
Terminal, was initially a trademark for a small earth station marketed in the 1980s by Telcom General in the USA. Its success as a
generic name probably comes from the appealing association of its
ﬁrst letter V, which establishes a ‘victorious’ context, or may be perceived as a friendly sign of participation, and SAT which deﬁnitely
establishes some reference to satellite communications.
In this book, the use of the word ‘terminal’ which appears in the
clariﬁcation of the acronym will be replaced by ‘earth station’, or
station for short, which is the more common designation in the ﬁeld
of satellite communications for the equipment assembly allowing
reception from or transmission to a satellite. The word terminal
will be used to designate the end user equipment (telephone set,
facsimile machine, television set, computer, etc.) which generates
or accepts the trafﬁc that is conveyed within VSAT networks. This
complies with regulatory texts, such as those of the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU), where for instance equipment
generating data trafﬁc, such as computers, are named ‘Data Terminal
Equipment’ (DTE).

INTRODUCTION

VSATs are one of the intermediary steps of the general trend
in earth station size reduction that has been observed in satellite
communications since the launch of the ﬁrst communication satellites in the mid 1960s. Indeed, earth stations have evolved from the
large INTELSAT Standard A earth stations equipped with antennas
30 m wide, to today’s receive-only stations with antennas as small
as 60 cm for direct reception of television transmitted by broadcasting satellites, or hand held terminals for radiolocation such as
the Global Postioning System (GPS) receivers. Present day hand
held satellite phones (IRIDIUM, GLOBALSTAR) are pocket size.
Figure 1.1 illustrates this trend.
Therefore, VSATs are at the lower end of a product line which
offers a large variety of communication services; at the upper end
are large stations (often called trunking stations) which support large
capacity satellite links. They are mainly used within international
switching networks to support trunk telephony services between
countries, possibly on different continents. Figure 1.2 illustrates how
such stations collect trafﬁc from end users via terrestrial links that
are part of the public switched network of a given country. These stations are quite expensive, with costs in the range of $10 million, and
require important civil works for their installation. Link capacities
are in the range of a few thousand telephone channels, or equivalently about one hundred Mbs−1 . They are owned and operated
by national telecom operators, such as the PTTs, or large private
telecom companies.

Trunking stations

At the lower end are VSATs. These are small stations with antenna
diameters less than 2.4 m, hence the name ‘small aperture’ which
refers to the area of the antenna. Such stations cannot support
satellite links with large capacities, but they are cheap, with manufacturing costs in the range of $1000 to $5000, and easy to install any
where, on the roof of a building or on a parking lot. Installation costs
are usually less than $2000. Therefore, VSATs are within the ﬁnancial capabilities of small corporate companies, and can be used to set
up rapidly small capacity satellite links in a ﬂexible way. Capacities
are of the order of a few tens of kbs−1 , typically 56 or 64 kbs−1 .
The low cost of VSATs has made these very popular, with a market
growth of the order of 20–25% per year in the nineties. There were

4

INTRODUCTION

about 50 000 VSATs in operation worldwide in 1990, and more than
600 000 twelve years later. This trend is likely to continue.
Referring to transportation, VSATs are for information transport,
the equivalent of personal cars for human transport, while the large
earth stations mentioned earlier are like public buses or trains.
At this point it is worth noting that VSATs, like personal cars, are
available at one’s premises. This avoids the need for using any public
network links to access the earth station. Indeed, the user can directly
plug into the VSAT equipment his own communication terminals
such as a telephone or video set, personal computer, printer, etc.
Therefore, VSATs appear as natural means to bypass public network
operators by directly accessing satellite capacity. They are ﬂexible
tools for establishing private networks, for instance between the
different sites of a company. Figure 1.3 illustrates this aspect by
satellite

emphasising the positioning of VSATs near the user compared to
trunking stations, which are located at the top level of the switching
hierarchy of a switched public network.
The bypass opportunity offered by VSAT networks has not always
been well accepted by national telecom operators as it could mean
loss of revenue, as a result of business trafﬁc being diverted from the
public network. This has initiated conservative policies by national
telecom operators opposing the deregulation of the communications
sector. In some regions of the world, and particularly in Europe, this
has been a strong restraint to the development of VSAT networks.

1.2

VSAT NETWORK CONFIGURATIONS

As illustrated in Figure 1.3, VSATs are connected by radio frequency
(RF) links via a satellite, with a so-called uplink from the station to
the satellite and a so-called downlink from the satellite to the station (Figure 1.4). The overall link from station to station, sometimes
called hop, consists of an uplink and a downlink. A radio frequency
link is a modulated carrier conveying information. Basically the
satellite receives the uplinked carriers from the transmitting earth
stations within the ﬁeld of view of its receiving antenna, ampliﬁes
those carriers, translates their frequency to a lower band in order to
avoid possible output/input interference, and transmits the ampliﬁed carriers to the stations located within the ﬁeld of view of its
transmitting antenna. A more detailed description of the satellite
architecture is given in Chapter 2 (section 2.1).
Present VSAT networks use geostationary satellites, which are
satellites orbiting in the equatorial plane of the earth at an altitude
above the earth surface of 35 786 km. It will be shown in Chapter 2

that the orbit period at this altitude is equal to that of the rotation
of the earth. As the satellite moves in its circular orbit in the same
direction as the earth rotates, the satellite appears from any station
on the ground as a ﬁxed relay in the sky. Figure 1.5 illustrates this
geometry. It should be noted that the distance from an earth station
to the geostationary satellite induces a radio frequency carrier power
attenuation of typically 200 dB on both uplink and downlink, and a
propagation delay from earth station to earth station (hop delay) of
about 0.25 s (see Chapter 2, section 2.3).
As a result of its apparent ﬁxed position in the sky, the satellite
can be used 24 hours a day as a permanent relay for the uplinked
radio frequency carriers. Those carriers are downlinked to all earth
stations visible from the satellite (shaded area on the earth in
Figure 1.5). Thanks to its apparent ﬁxed position in the sky, there is
no need for tracking the satellite. This simpliﬁes VSAT equipment
and installation.
As all VSATs are visible from the satellite, carriers can be relayed
by the satellite from any VSAT to any other VSAT in the network,
as illustrated by Figure 1.6.
Regarding meshed VSAT networks, as shown in Figure 1.6, one
must take into account the following limitations:
– typically 200 dB carrier power attenuation on the uplink and the
downlink as a result of the distance to and from a geostationary satellite;
– limited satellite transponder radio frequency power, typically a
few tens of watts;
– small size of the VSAT, which limits its transmitted power and
its receiving sensitivity.
As a result of the above, it may well be that the demodulated
signals at the receiving VSAT do not match the quality requested by
the user terminals. Therefore direct links from VSAT to VSAT may
not be acceptable.

directions)

The solution then is to install in the network a station larger than a
VSAT, called the hub. The hub station has a larger antenna size than
that of a VSAT, say 4 m to 11 m, resulting in a higher gain than that
of a typical VSAT antenna, and is equipped with a more powerful
transmitter. As a result of its improved capability, the hub station
is able to receive adequately all carriers transmitted by the VSATs,
and to convey the desired information to all VSATs by means of its
own transmitted carriers. The architecture of the network becomes
star-shaped as shown in Figures 1.7 and 1.8. The links from the hub
to the VSAT are named outbound links. Those from the VSAT to
the hub are named inbound links. Both inbound and outbound links

There are two types of star-shaped VSAT network:
– two-way networks (Figure 1.7), where VSATs can transmit and
receive. Such networks support interactive trafﬁc;
– one-way networks (Figure 1.8), where the hub transmits carriers to
receive-only VSATs. This conﬁguration supports broadcasting

USER TERMINAL CONNECTIVITY

User terminals are connected to VSATs and may be expected to
communicate with one another thanks to the VSAT network.

10

INTRODUCTION

The two-way connectivity between user terminals can be achieved
in two ways, depending on the VSAT network conﬁguration:
– either thanks to direct links from VSAT to VSAT via satellite, should the link performance meet the requested quality.
This applies in particular to the mesh conﬁguration illustrated
in Figure 1.6. The user terminal connectivity is illustrated in
Figure 1.9;
– or by double hop links via satellite in a star-shaped network,
with a ﬁrst hop from VSAT to hub and then a second hop using
the hub as a relay to the destination VSAT (as illustrated in
Figure 1.10).

INTRODUCTION

11

Comparing Figure 1.9 and 1.10 indicates a smaller antenna for
VSATs within a star conﬁguration than for VSATs in a meshed
network. This is due to the linkage to a hub for VSATs in a starshaped network, which provides more power on the outbound link
and an improved ability to receive carriers transmitted by VSATs
on the inbound link, compared to VSATs in a meshed network, as a
result of the larger size of the hub.
In conclusion, star-shaped networks are imposed by power limitations resulting from the small size of the VSAT earth stations,
in conjunction with power limitation of the satellite transponder.
This is particularly true when low cost VSATs are desired. Meshed
networks are considered whenever such limitations do not hold.
Meshed networks have the advantage of a reduced propagation
delay (single hop delay is 0.25 s instead of 0.5 s for double hop)
which is especially of interest for telephony services.

1.4

VSAT NETWORK APPLICATIONS AND TYPES
OF TRAFFIC

VSAT networks have both civilian and military applications. These
will now be presented.

1.4.1

Civilian VSAT networks

1.4.1.1 Types of service
As mentioned in the previous section, VSAT networks can be conﬁgured as one-way or two-way networks. Table 1.1 gives examples
of services supported by VSAT networks according to these two
classes.
It can be noted that most of the services supported by two-way
VSAT networks deal with interactive data trafﬁc, where the user
terminals are most often personal computers. The most notable
exceptions are voice communications and satellite news gathering.
Voice communications on a VSAT network means telephony with
possibly longer delays than those incurred on terrestrial lines, as
a result of the long satellite path. Telephony services imply full
connectivity, and delays are typically 0.25 s or 0.50 s depending on
the selected network conﬁguration, as mentioned above.
Satellite news gathering (SNG) can be viewed as a temporary
network using transportable VSATs, sometimes called ‘ﬂy-away’
stations, which are transported by car or aircraft and set up at a
location where news reporters can transmit video signals to a hub

located near the company’s studio. Of course the service could be
considered as inbound only, if it were not for the need to check
the uplink from the remote site, and to be in touch by telephone
with the staff at the studio. As ﬂy-away VSATs are constantly
transported, assembled and disassembled, they must be robust,
lightweight and easy to install. Today they weigh typically 100 kg
and can be installed in less than 20 minutes. Figure 1.11 shows a
picture of a ﬂy-away VSAT station.

1.4.1.2 Types of traffic
Depending on the service, the trafﬁc ﬂow between the hub and the
VSATs may have different characteristics and requirements.
Data transfer or broadcasting, which belongs to the category of oneway services, typically displays ﬁle transfers of one to one hundred
megabytes of data. This kind of service is not delay sensitive, but
requires a high integrity of the data which are transferred. Examples
of applications are computer download and distribution of data to
remote sites.
Interactive data is a two-way service corresponding to several
transactions per minute and per terminal of single packets 50 to
250 bytes long on both inbound and outbound links. The required
response time is typically a few seconds. Examples of applications
are bank transactions and electronic funds transfer at point of sale.

Inquiry/response is a two-way service corresponding to several transactions per minute and terminal. Inbound packets (typically 30–100 bytes) are shorter than outbound packets (typically
500–2000 bytes). The required response time is typically a few seconds. Examples of applications are airline or hotel reservations and
database enquiries.
Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) is a two-way
service corresponding to one transaction per second or minute
per terminal. Inbound packets (typically 100 bytes) are longer than
outbound packets (typically 10 bytes). The required response time
ranges from a few seconds to a few minutes. What is most important
is the high data security level and the low power consumption of the
terminal. Examples of applications are control and monitoring of
pipelines, offshore platforms, electric utilities and water resources.
Table 1.2 summarises the above discussion.

1.4.2

Military VSAT networks

VSAT networks have been adopted by many military forces in the
world. Indeed the inherent ﬂexibility in the deployment of VSATs
makes them a valuable means of installing temporary communications links between small units in the battleﬁeld and headquarters
located near the hub. Moreover, the topology of a star-shaped network ﬁts well into the natural information ﬂow between ﬁeld units
and command base. Frequency bands are at X-band, with uplinks
in the 7.9–8.4 GHz band and downlinks in the 7.25–7.75 GHz band.
The military use VSAT must be a small, low weight, low power
station that is easy to operate under battleﬁeld conditions. As
an example, the manpack station developed by the UK Defence
Research Agency (DRA) for its Milpico VSAT military network is
equipped with a 45 cm antenna, weighs less than 17 kg and can be
set up within 90 seconds. It supports data and vocoded voice at
2.4 kbs−1 . In order to do so, the hub stations need to be equipped
with antennas as large as 14 m. Another key requirement is low
probability of detection by hostile interceptors. Spread spectrum
techniques are largely used [EVA99, Chapter 23].

1.5

VSAT NETWORKS: INVOLVED PARTIES

The applications of VSAT networks identiﬁed in the previous section
clearly indicate that VSAT technology is appropriate to business or
military applications. Reasons for this are the inherent ﬂexibility

16

INTRODUCTION

of VSAT technology, as mentioned in section 1.1, cost savings and
reliability, as will be discussed in section 3.3.
Which are the involved parties as far as corporate communications
are concerned?
– The user is most often a company employee using ofﬁce communication terminals such as personal computers, telephone sets or
fax machines. On other occasions the terminal is transportable,
as with satellite news gathering (SNG). Here the user is mostly
interested in transmitting video to the company studio. The
terminal may be ﬁxed but not located in an ofﬁce, as with
supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) applications.
– The VSAT network operator may be the user’s company itself,
if the company owns the network, or it may be a telecom
company (in many countries it is the national public telecom

operator) who then leases the service. The VSAT network operator is then a customer to the network provider and/or the
equipment provider.
– The VSAT network provider has the technical ability to dimension
and install the network. It elaborates the network management
system (NMS) and designs the corresponding software. Its inputs
are the customer’s needs, and its customers are network operators. The network provider may be a private company or a
national telecom operator.
– The equipment provider sells the VSATs and/or the hub which
it manufactures. It may be the network provider or a different
party.
For the VSAT network to work, some satellite capacity must be
provided. The satellite may be owned by the user’s company but
this is a rare example of ‘vertical integration’, and most often the
satellite is operated by a different party. This party may be a national
or international private satellite operator.
The above parties are those involved in the contractual matters.
Other parties are on the regulatory side and their involvement will
be ﬁrst presented in section 1.9.
Figure 1.12 summarises the above discussion. The terminology
will be used throughout the book and therefore Figure 1.12 can
serve as a convenient reference.

1.6
1.6.1

VSAT NETWORK OPTIONS
Star or mesh?

Section 1.2 introduced the two main architectures of a VSAT network: star and mesh. The question now is: is one architecture more
appropriate than the other?
The answer depends on three factors:
– the structure of information ﬂow within the network;
– the requested link quality and capacity;
– the transmission delay.
These three aspects will now be discussed.

1.6.1.1 Structure of information flow
VSAT networks can support different types of application, and each
has an optimum network conﬁguration:

18

INTRODUCTION

– Broadcasting: a central site distributes information to many
remote sites with no back ﬂow of information. Hence a starshaped one-way network supports the service at the lowest cost.
– Corporate network: most often companies have a centralised
structure with administration and management performed at
a central site, and manufacturing or sales performed at sites
scattered over a geographical area. Information from the remote
sites needs to be gathered at the central site for decision making,
and information from the central site (for example, relating to
task sharing) has to be distributed to the remote ones. Such an
information ﬂow can be supported partially by a star-shaped oneway VSAT network, for instance for information distribution, or
supported totally by a two-way star-shaped VSAT network.
In the ﬁrst case, VSATs need to be receive-only and are less
expensive than in the latter case where interactivity is required,
as this implies VSATs equipped with both transmit and receive
equipment. Typically the cost of the transmitting equipment is
two-thirds that of an interactive VSAT.
– Interactivity between distributed sites: other companies or organisations with a decentralised structure are more likely to comprise many sites interacting with one another. A meshed VSAT
network using direct single hop connections from VSAT to
VSAT is hence most desirable. The other option is a two-way
star-shaped network with double hop connections from VSAT
to VSAT via the hub.
Table 1.3 summarises the above discussion.
Regulatory aspects are also to be taken into account (see section 1.9).

1.6.1.2 Link quality and capacity
The link considered here is the link from the transmitting station
to the receiving one. Such a link may comprise several parts. For
instance a single hop link would comprise an uplink and a downlink
(Figure 1.4), a double hop link would comprise two single hop links,
one being inbound and the other outbound (Figure 1.10).
When dealing with link quality, one must refer to the quality
of a given signal. Actually, two types of signal are involved: the
modulated carrier at the input to the receiver and the baseband
signals delivered to the user terminal once the carrier has been
demodulated (Figure 1.13). The input to the receiver terminates
the overall radio frequency link from the transmitting station to the
receiving one, with its two link components, the uplink and the

the user-to-user baseband link from the output of the device generating
bits (message source) to the input of the device to which those bits
are transmitted (message sink).
The link quality of the radio frequency link is measured by the
(C/N0 )T ratio at the station receiver input, where C is the received
carrier power and N0 the power spectral density of noise [MAR02
Chapter 5].
The baseband link quality is measured by the information bit error
rate (BER). It is conditioned by the Eb /N0 value at the receiver input,
where Eb (J) is the energy per information bit and N0 (WHz−1 ) is the
noise power spectral density. As indicated in Chapter 5, section 5.7,
the Eb /N0 ratio depends on the overall radio frequency link quality
(C/N0 )T and the capacity of the link, measured by its information bit

Figure 1.14 indicates the general trend which relates EIRP to G/T
in a VSAT network, considering a given baseband signal quality in
terms of constant BER. EIRP designates the effective isotropic radiated
power of the transmitting equipment and G/T is the ﬁgure of merit
of the receiving equipment (see Chapter 5 for deﬁnition of the EIRP
and of the ﬁgure of merit).
As can be seen from Figure 1.14, the double hop from VSAT
to VSAT via the hub, when compared to a single hop, allows an
increased link capacity without modifying the size of the VSATs.
This option also involves a larger transmission delay.

1.6.1.3 Transmission delay
With a single hop link from VSAT to VSAT in a meshed network,
the propagation delay is about 0.25 s. With a double hop from VSAT
to VSAT via the hub, the propagation delay is twice as much, i.e.
about 0.5 s.
Double hop may be a problem for voice communications. However it is not a severe problem for video or data transmission.
Table 1.4 summarises the above discussion. Given the EIRP and
G/T values for a VSAT, the designer can decide upon either a large
delay from VSAT to VSAT and a larger capacity or a small delay and

a lower capacity, by implementing either a star-shaped network, or

1.6.2

Data/voice/video

Depending on his needs, the customer may want to transmit either
one kind of signal or a mix of different signals. Data and voice are
transmitted in a digital format, while video may be analogue or
digital. When digital, the video signal may beneﬁt from bandwidth
efﬁcient compression techniques.

1.6.2.1 Data communications
VSATs have emerged from the need to transmit data. Standard
VSAT products offer data transmission facilities. Rates offered to
the user range typically from 50 bs−1 to 64 kbs−1 with interface ports
such as RS-232, for bit rates lower than 20 kbs−1 , RS-422, V35 and
X21 for higher bit rates. A local area network (LAN) interface is most
often provided (using an RJ-45 connector, for instance). Appendix 3
gives some details on the functions of such ports.
Data distribution can be implemented in combination with video
transmission, using for instance the DVB-S standard.

1.6.2.2 Voice communications
Voice communications are of interest on two-way networks only.
They can be performed at low rate using voice encoding (vocoders).
Typical information rates then range from 4.8 kbs−1 to 9.6 kbs−1 .
They can also be combined with data communications (for instance
up to 4 voice channels may be multiplexed with data or facsimile
channels on a single 64 kbs−1 channel).
On VSAT networks voice communications suffer from delay associated with vocoder processing (about 50 ms) and propagation on
satellite links (about 500 ms for a double hop). Therefore the user

22

INTRODUCTION

may prefer to connect to terrestrial networks which offer a reduced
delay. Voice communications can be a niche market for VSATs as
a service to locations where land lines are not available, or for
transportable terminal applications.

1.6.2.3 Video communications
On the outbound link (from hub to VSAT)
Video communications make use of the usual TV standards (NTSC,
PAL or SECAM) in combination with FM modulation, or can be
implemented using the Digital Video Broadcasting by Satellite
(DVB-S) standard, possibly in combination with distribution of data.
On the inbound link
As a result of the limited power of the VSAT on the uplink, video
transmission is feasible at a low rate, possibly in the form of slow
motion image transmission using video coding and compression.

1.6.3

Fixed/demand assignment

The earth stations of a VSAT network communicate via the satellite
by means of modulated carriers. Any such carrier is assigned a
portion of the resource offered by the satellite in terms of powered
bandwidth. This assignment can be deﬁned once for all, and this is
called ‘ﬁxed assignment’ (FA), or in accordance with requests from
the VSATs depending on the trafﬁc they have to transmit, and this
is called ‘demand assignment’ (DA).

1.6.3.1 Fixed assignment (FA)
Figure 1.15 illustrates the principle of ﬁxed assignment. A star-shaped
network conﬁguration is considered in the ﬁgure but the principle
applies to a meshed network conﬁguration as well. The satellite
resource is shared in a ﬁxed manner by all stations whatever the
trafﬁc demand. It may be that at a given instant the VSAT trafﬁc
load is larger than that which can be accommodated by capacity
allocated to that VSAT as determined by its share of the satellite
resource. The VSAT must store or reject the trafﬁc demand, and this
either increases the delay or introduces blocking of calls, in spite

of the fact that other VSATs may have excess capacity available.
Because of this, the network is not optimally exploited.

1.6.3.2 Demand assignment (DA)
With demand assignment, VSATs share a variable portion of the
overall satellite resource as illustrated in Figure 1.16. VSATs use
only the capacity which is required for their own transmission, and
leave the capacity in excess for use by other VSATs. Of course this
variable share can be exercised only within the limits of the total
satellite capacity allocated to the network.
Demand assignment is performed by means of requests for
capacity transmitted by individual VSATs. Those requests are transmitted to the hub station, or to a trafﬁc control station, should the
management of the demand assignment technique be centralised,
or to all other VSATs, if the demand assignment is distributed.

INTRODUCTION

Those requests are transmitted on a speciﬁc signalling channel, or
piggy-backed on the trafﬁc messages. With centralised management,
the hub station or the trafﬁc control station replies by allocating to
the VSAT the appropriate resource, either a frequency band or a
time slot. With distributed management, all VSATs keep a record of
occupied and available resource. This is discussed in more detail in
Chapter 4, section 4.6.
From the above, it can be recognised that demand assignment
offers a better use of the satellite resource but at the expense of a
higher system cost and a delay in connection set-up. However, a
larger number of stations can share the satellite resource. Hence the
higher investment cost is compensated for by a larger return on
investment.
The centralised/distributed management option depends on the
network architecture: a centralised control is easier to perform with
a star-shaped network, as all trafﬁc ﬂows through the hub, which
then is the natural candidate for demand assignment control. With
a mesh-shaped network, both centralised and distributed control
can be envisaged. Delay for link set-up is shorter with distributed
control, as a single hop (about 0.25 s) is sufﬁcient to inform all VSATs
in the network of the request and the corresponding resource occupancy, while a double hop (about 0.5 s) is necessary for the request
to proceed to the central station, and for that station to allocate
the corresponding resource. Finally, as demand assignment implies
charging the remote sites according to the resource occupancy,
billing and accounting is more easily handled by a centralised
control.

1.6.4

Frequency bands

VSAT networks are supposed to operate within the so-called ‘ﬁxed
satellite service’ (FSS) deﬁned within the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). The only exception is when data is broadcast
in association with broadcasting of television or audio programmes,
within the so-called ‘broadcasting satellite service’ (BSS).
The FSS covers all satellite communications between stations
located while operating at given ‘speciﬁed ﬁxed points’ of the earth.
Transportable stations belong to this category, and hence the socalled ‘ﬂy-away’ stations should use the same frequency bands as
ﬁxed VSATs.
The most commonly used bands for commercial applications are
those allocated to the FSS at C-band and Ku-band. X-band is used by
military systems. Few VSAT networks at Ka-band are commercial,

most are experimental. Figure 1.17 gives the extension of these bands
and provides some regulatory information.
The ﬁgure displays uplinks and downlinks by means of arrows
oriented upwards or downwards. The black arrows indicate a
primary and exclusive allocation for FSS, which means in short

26

INTRODUCTION

Figure 1.18 Regions 1, 2 and 3 in the world

that the FSS is protected against interference from any other
service, which is then considered secondary. The striped arrows
indicate a primary but shared allocation, which means that the
allocated frequency bands can also be used by services other
than FSS with the same rights. Coordination is then mandatory,
according to the procedure described in the ITU Radio Regulations. Figure 1.18 displays the geographical limits of regions R1,
R2 and R3.
As mentioned above, data may be carried in association with video
signals within the frequency band allocated to the broadcasting
satellite service. Possible bands are 11.7–12.5 GHz in regions 1
and 3, and 12.2–12.7 GHz in region 2, ﬁlling in the gaps of the
bands represented in Figure 1.17 which deals with the ﬁxed satellite
service only.
The selection of a frequency band for operating a VSAT network
depends ﬁrst on the availability of satellites covering the region
where the VSAT network is to be installed.
To be considered next is the potential problem of interference.
Interference designates unwanted carriers entering the receiving
equipment along with the wanted ones. The unwanted carriers
perturb the demodulator by acting as noise, adding to the natural
thermal noise. Interference is a problem with VSATs because the
small size of the antenna (small aperture) translates into a radiation
pattern with a large beamwidth. Indeed as shown by equation (1.2)
the half power beamwidth θ3dB of an antenna relates to the product
of its diameter by frequency (see Appendix 4), as follows:
θ3dB =

70 c
Df

(degrees)

(1.2)

INTRODUCTION

27

where D (m) is the diameter of the antenna, f (Hz) is the frequency,
and c = 3 × 108 ms−1 is the velocity of light.
Therefore, the smaller the antenna diameter, the larger the beamwidth, and the off-axis interfering carriers are more likely to be
emitted or received with high antenna gain. How important this
perturbation can be is discussed in Chapter 5, section 5.5.
At this point it sufﬁces to mention that interference is more likely
to be a problem at C-band than at higher frequencies. There are two
reasons for this: ﬁrst, there is no primary and exclusive allocation
to FSS at C-band. Second, given the earth station antenna diameter,
interference is more important at C-band than at Ku-band, as the
beamwidth is inversely proportional to the frequency, and thus is
larger at C-band than at higher frequencies. To put this in perspective, equation (1.2) indicates, for a 1.8 m antenna, a beamwidth
angle of 3◦ at 4 GHz, and only 1◦ at 12 GHz. This means that the
receiving antenna is more likely to pick up carriers downlinked from
satellites adjacent to the desired one at C-band than at Ku-band,
especially as C-band satellites are many and hence nearer to each
other. A typical angular separation for C-band satellites is 3◦ , and is
therefore comparable to VSAT antenna beamwidth.
The same problem occurs on the uplink, where a small VSAT
antenna projects carrier power in a larger angle at C-band than at
Ku-band, and hence generates more interference on the uplink of
adjacent satellite systems. However this is not a major issue as the
transmit power of VSATs is weak.
Finally it should be understood that C-band and parts of Kuband are shared by terrestrial microwave relays, and this may be
another source of interference. Ku-band offers a dedicated band
free from any terrestrial microwave transmission (see black arrows
in Figure 1.17), which is not the case for C-band. This simpliﬁes
the positioning of the VSAT and hub station as no coordination is
implied.
Figure 1.19 summarises the various interfering paths mentioned
above.
Where the small size of the antenna is at a premium, and should
interference be too large, interference can be combated by using
a modulation technique named spread spectrum, which consists of
spreading the carrier in a much larger bandwidth than strictly required to transmit the information. This is an interesting technique as it
provides not only interference protection but also potential for Code
Division Multiple Access (CDMA) to a satellite channel. However,
as a result of the greater utilised bandwidth, it is less bandwidth
efﬁcient compared to alternative multiple access techniques such
as Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) or Time Division

One of the characteristics that must be taken into consideration
is rain attenuation. Some power margin has to be incorporated into
the network design to allow for the amount of power reduction
of received carriers due to rain. This margin increases the cost of
earth stations, and makes it prohibitive to provide enough carrier
power during a large thunderstorm/downpour. At Ku-band, short
(5–15 min) outages should be expected. Rain attenuation is higher
at Ka-band and outages are likely to be longer when such systems
develop. The great advantage of C-band is that it is not impaired by
rain attenuation at all.

Finally, the cost of the equipment is another driving factor for
choosing between C-band and Ku-band. Although C-band technology is cheaper, the larger size of the VSAT antenna for a similar
performance makes the VSAT more expensive than at Ku-band.
Table 1.5 summarises the advantages and drawbacks of the most
commonly available frequency bands.

1.6.5

Hub options

1.6.5.1 Dedicated large hub
A dedicated large hub (with antenna size in the range of 8–10 m)
supports a full single network with possibly thousands of VSATs
connected to it. The hub may be located at the customer’s organisation central site, with the host computer directly connected to
it. It offers the customer full control of the network. In periods of
expansion, changes in the network, or problems, this option may
simplify the customer’s life. However, a dedicated hub represents
the most expensive option and is only justiﬁed if its cost can be
amortised over a sufﬁciently large number of VSATs in the network.
The typical cost of a dedicated hub is in the region of $1 million.

1.6.5.2 Shared hub
Several separate networks may share a unique hub. With this
option, hub services are leased to VSAT network operators. Hence

30

INTRODUCTION

the network operators are faced with minimum capital investment
and this favours the initial implementation of a VSAT network.
Therefore, shared hubs are most suitable for the smaller networks
(less than 50 VSATs). However, sharing a hub has a number of
drawbacks:
Need for a connection from hub to host
A shared hub facility is generally not colocated with the customer’s
host computer. Hence a backhaul circuit is needed to connect the
hub to the host. The circuit may be a leased line or one provided
by a terrestrial switched telephone network. This adds an extra cost
to the VSAT network operation. Moreover, operational experience
has shown the backhaul circuit to be the weakest link in the chain.
Therefore this option means an increased failure risk. A possible
way to mitigate this potential problem area would be using route
diversity: for instance a microwave or satellite link could be used as
a back-up for this interconnection.
Possible limitation in future expansion
A shared hub may impose an unforeseen capacity limitation, as the
available capacity may be leased without notice to the other network
operators sharing the hub. Guarantees should contractually be asked
for by any network operator in this regard.

1.6.5.3 Mini-hub
The mini-hub is a small hub (with antenna size in the range of 2–5 m)
and a typical cost in the region of $100 000. It appeared as a result of
the increased power from satellites and the improved performance
of low-noise receiving equipment. The mini-hub has proved to be
an attractive solution, as it retains the advantages of a dedicated
hub at a reduced cost. It also eases possible installation problems
in connection with downtown areas or communities with zoning
restrictions, as a mini-hub entails a smaller antenna size and less rack
mounted equipment than a large dedicated hub or even a shared
hub. A typical mini-hub can support 300 to 400 remote VSATs.

look at the electronics container.
For a proper speciﬁcation of the ODU, as an interface to the
satellite, the following parameters are of importance:
– the transmit and receive frequency bands;
– the transmit and receive step size for adjusting the frequency
of the transmitted carrier or for tuning to the received carrier
frequency;

– the equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP), which determines the performance of the radio frequency uplink. The EIRP
depends on the value of the antenna gain, and hence its size and
transmit frequency, and on the transmitting ampliﬁer output
power (see Chapter 5, section 5.2);
– the ﬁgure of merit G/T, which determines the performance of the
radio frequency downlink. The G/T ratio depends on the value
of the antenna gain, and hence its size and receive frequency,
and on the noise temperature of the receiver (see Chapter 5,
section 5.3);
– the antenna sidelobe gain variation with off-axis angle which
controls the off-axis EIRP and G/T, hence determining the levels
of produced and received interference.
Operating temperature range, wind loading under operational
and survival conditions, rain and humidity are also to be considered.
Table 1.6 displays typical values for the ODU of a VSAT. LNA
typical noise temperature of today’s VSAT receiver is 50 K at Cband and 120 K at Ku-band. Advances in HEMT FET technology
now make possible uncooled LNAs having noise temperatures of
35 K at C-band and 80 K at Ku-band.

1.7.1.2 The indoor unit (IDU)
The indoor unit installed at the user’s facility is shown in Figure 1.23.
In order to connect his terminals to the VSAT, the user must access
the ports installed on the rear panel of the outdoor unit, shown in
the photograph in Figure 1.24.
For a proper speciﬁcation of the IDU, as an interface to the user’s
terminals or to a local area network (LAN), the following parameters
are of importance:
– number of ports;
– type of ports: mechanical, electrical, functional and procedural
interface. This is often speciﬁed by reference to a standard, such
as those mentioned in section 1.6.2 and in Appendix 3;
– port speed: this is the maximum bit rate at which data can be
exchanged between the user terminal and the VSAT indoor unit
on a given port. The actual data rate can be lower.
Coherent modulation schemes such as biphase shift keying (BPSK)
or quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) are used. For acceptable

Apart from the size and the number of subsystems, there is little
functional difference between a hub and a VSAT, so that most of the
content of the above section applies here. The major difference is that
the indoor unit of a hub station interfaces to either a host computer
or to a public switched network or private lines, depending on
whether the hub is a dedicated or a shared one (see above section on

INTRODUCTION

are constantly exchanged between the NMS and the VSATs and
compete with the normal trafﬁc for network resources.

1.7.2.1 Operational functions
Operational functions relate to the network management and provide the capability to reconﬁgure the network dynamically by
adding, or deleting, VSAT stations, carriers and network interfaces.
Operational functions also include monitoring and controlling the
performance and status of the hub and each VSAT station, and all
associated data ports of the network. This entails operational management tools which provide real-time assignment and connectivity
of VSATs, and management and control of new installations and
conﬁgurations.
The network control software allows automatic dynamic allocation of capacity to VSATs with bursty interactive trafﬁc and
to VSATs that will occasionally be used for stream trafﬁc (see
Chapter 4, section 4.3). No operator intervention is required to effect
this temporary capacity reallocation.
The NMS notiﬁes the operator in the case of capacity saturation,
which prevents more VSAT users from entering the service. The
NMS also handles all aspects related to alarm and failure diagnosis.
In particular, in case of any power interruptions at the VSAT
stations, the NMS downloads all the relevant software and system
parameters for operation restart.

1.7.2.2 Administrative functions
Administrative functions deal with inventory of equipment, records
of network usage, security and billing.
The NMS keeps an account of the VSAT stations installed and
operated, the equipment conﬁguration within the hub and each
VSAT station, and the port conﬁguration of each network interface.
This information is available on request by the operator, along with
statistical information on trafﬁc, number of failures, average time
of data transmission delay, etc. The information can be analysed
and printed on a daily, weekly or monthly basis as well as being
stored on magnetic tape for future reference. It forms the basis
for trafﬁc and trend performance analysis, cost distribution based
upon usage, etc.
The above long and diverse list of functions to be performed by
the NMS shows its important role for the network. Actually, the
adequacy of the NMS’s response to the user’s needs makes the

difference between popular network providers and those who fail
to survive in the market.

ECONOMIC ASPECTS

VSAT business faces competition in regions of the world where
terrestrial networks are available. For the same grade of service, terrestrial digital data service networks and packet switched networks
are probable contenders. Provided that desired network reliability,
response time and throughput are achieved, then the economic
comparison should be made on the basis of cost per month per site.
Such comparisons with alternative solutions must be made on a
case-by-case basis as they depend on many local factors, and also
may be time dependent. In general terms, a VSAT network is a cost
effective solution if the unique property of the satellite to broadcast
information is well used.
To illustrate the budget headings of a typical VSAT network
and the impact of the number of VSATs, Tables 1.8 to 1.10 display
the budget of three networks considering a typical interactive data
application: Table 1.8 relates to a small network with 30 VSAT
stations and a shared hub, Table 1.9 refers to a network of 300
VSAT stations and a dedicated mini-hub, and Table 1.10 relates to a
network with 1000 VSAT stations and a dedicated large hub.
The cost per month per VSAT is calculated assuming a ﬁve year
amortisation. The $2 000 equipment cost of a VSAT is applicable to
a station equipped with a 1.8 m antenna, a 2 W transmitter power,
and 4 output user ports. This cost ﬁgure corresponds to an order for
a small number (30 units). A discount of 20% is applicable should
300 VSATs be ordered, and 30% for 1000 VSATs. This is reﬂected in
Tables 1.9 and 1.10. Installation cost is taken equal to one manday
plus professional expenses, or typically $700 per VSAT. Spare parts
represent 10% of the equipment cost, and the annual maintenance
cost is taken equal to $500 per VSAT.
The VSAT transmits information at bit rate Rb = 64 kbs−1 , with
code rate ρ = 1/2. Therefore the transmitted bit rate is Rc =
128 kbs−1 . Considering BPSK modulation, with spectral efﬁciency
(ratio of bit rate upon used bandwidth) Γ = 0.5 bs−1 .Hz−1 , including
guard bands, the carrier bandwidth is Binb = Rc /Γ = 250 kHz.
The access to the satellite is by time division multiple access
(TDMA) and it is assumed that thirty VSAT stations share one
inbound link. Therefore, the inbound average capacity per VSAT is
64 kbs−1 divided by 30, i.e. 2133 bs−1 .

The outbound link is a time division multiplex (TDM) at information bit rate Rb = 256 kbs−1 , with code rate = 1/2. The transmitted
bit rate is Rc = 512 kbs−1 and the utilised band is Boutb = 1 MHz. An
outbound link is dedicated to each group of VSATs. Therefore, the
outbound average capacity per VSAT is 256 kbs−1 divided by 30, i.e.
8533 bs−1 .
Table 1.8 refers to a network with 30 VSATs, with one inbound link
and one outbound link, so that the utilised transponder bandwidth
is B1 = Binb + Boutb = 1.25 MHz.
Table 1.9 refers to a network with 300 VSATs, with 10 inbound
links and 10 outbound links (one per VSAT group), so that the
utilised transponder bandwidth is B2 = 10(Binb + Boutb ) = 12.5 MHz.
Table 1.10 refers to a network with 1000 VSATs, with 34 inbound
links and 34 outbound links, so that the utilised transponder bandwidth is B3 = 34(Binb + Boutb ) = 42.5 MHz.
A cost of $50 000 per year is considered for the non-pre-emptible
lease of 1 MHz of transponder bandwidth.
To operate and maintain a dedicated large hub or a mini-hub, a
staff of eight people working round the clock in eight-hour shifts is

considered with a cost per man-year of $40 000. Hence the annual
staff cost in Tables 1.9 and 1.10 is $320 000. With a shared hub
(Table 1.8) the staff is employed by the owner of the hub and the
corresponding cost is charged to the client as part of the lease cost.
The licence structure is based on a one-time fee of $8000 and an
annual fee per VSAT of $100. It can be noted that the one-time fee,
although it may be considered an expensive one, has little impact
on the cost per month per VSAT.
Comparing Tables 1.8 to 1.10 indicates a decreasing cost per site
per month as the number of VSATs grows.

REGULATORY ASPECTS

Regulations in the ﬁeld of VSAT networks entail several aspects:
– licensing;
– access to the space segment;
– permission for installation.

Licensing

A licence is to be delivered by the national telecommunications
authority of a country where any earth station as a part of a
network, be it the hub, a control station or a VSAT, is planned to be
installed and operated.
The concern reﬂected here is to ensure compatibility between radio
networks by avoiding harmful interference between different systems. By doing so, any licensed operator within a certain frequency
band is recognised as not causing unacceptable interference to
others, and is protected from interference caused by others.
In the past, national telecommunication authorities have required
licensing of individual VSAT terminals in addition to requiring a
network operator’s licence. Then, the US Federal Communication
Commission (FCC) implemented with success a blanket licensing
approach for VSATs operated within the US. With blanket licensing, VSATs are conﬁgured based upon technical criteria (power
level, frequency, etc.) to eliminate the risk of interference, so a single

INTRODUCTION

43

licence can be issued covering a large number of VSAT terminals.
Blanket licensing has since gained interest among national telecommunications authorities all over the world, as a result of equipment manufacturers complying with the recommendations issued
by international standardisation bodies, such as the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the European Telecommunications Standard Institute (ETSI). Relevant documentation from
these bodies is available at http://www.itu.int/home/index.html
and http://www.etsi.org/.
A licence usually entails the payment of a licence fee, which is
most often in two parts: a one-time fee for the licensing work and
an annual charge per station.
The licensing procedure is simpler when the network is national,
as only one telecom authority is involved. For transborder networks,
licences must be obtained from the different national authorities
where the relevant earth stations are planned to be installed and
operated, and rules often differ from one country to another. To
facilitate the access to these rules, telecommunications authorities around the world have begun posting data related to their
nations’ VSAT regulatory conditions on the World Wide Web.
Information on these websites can be obtained from the International VSAT Regulatory Portal of the Global VSAT Forum (GVF)
(http://www.gvf.org/regulation/portal/index.cfm#).

1.9.2

Access to the space segment

This deals with the performance and operational procedures that
satellite operators request from earth station operators for transmission of carriers to, and from, their satellite transponders. Most often
such requirements are based on the ITU-R Recommendations, but
some satellite operators may impose special constraints.
In any case, the applicant operator of a VSAT network is compelled
to fulﬁl the requirements imposed by the satellite operator in terms
of earth station maximum EIRP, G/T, frequency stability and control
of transmission.

1.9.3

Local regulations

Installation of a VSAT encompasses problems relating to planning or
zoning controls, building and person safety. The VSAT should comply to local regulations dealing with environmental protection such
as antenna dish size, colour and shape. Finally, landlord permission

44

INTRODUCTION

to dig for cable ducts or install roof mounted antennas should be
treated as contractual matters between the landlord and the tenant.

1.10

CONCLUSIONS

This conclusion summarises the perceived advantages and drawbacks of VSAT networks.

1.10.1

Advantages

1.10.1.1 Point-to-multipoint and point-to-point
communications
A VSAT network offers communications between remote terminals.
As a result of the power limitation resulting from the imposed small
size and low cost of the remote station, a VSAT network is most often
star-shaped with remotes linked to a larger station called a hub. This
star conﬁguration often well reﬂects the structure of information
ﬂow within most large organisations which have a point of central
control where the hub can be installed. The star conﬁguration itself
is not a severe limitation to the effectiveness of a VSAT network
as point-to-point communications, which would conveniently be
supported by a meshed network, can still be achieved via a double
hop, using the hub as a central switch to the network.

1.10.1.2 Asymmetry of data transfer
As a result of its asymmetric conﬁguration, a star-shaped network
displays different capacities on the inbound link and on the outbound link. This may be an advantage considering the customer
need for asymmetric capacities in most of his applications. Should
he use leased terrestrial lines which are inherently symmetric, i.e.
offering equal capacity in both directions, the customer would have
to pay for unused capacity.

1.10.1.3 Flexibility
A VSAT network inherently provides a quick response time for
network additions and reconﬁgurations (one or two days) as a
result of the easy displacement and installation of a remote station.

INTRODUCTION

45

1.10.1.4 Private corporate networks
A VSAT network offers its operator end-to-end control over transmission quality and reliability. It also protects him from possible
and unexpected tariff ﬂuctuations, by offering price stability and
the possibility to forecast its communication expenses. Therefore it
is an adequate support to private corporate networks.

1.10.1.5 Low bit error rate
The bit error rate usually encountered on VSAT links is typically
10−7 .

1.10.1.6 Distance-insensitive cost
The cost of a link in a VSAT network is not sensitive to distance.
Hence, cost savings are expected if the network displays a large
number of sites and a high geographical dispersion.

1.10.2

Drawbacks

1.10.2.1 Interference sensitivity
A radio frequency link in a VSAT network is subject to interference
as a result of the small earth station antenna size.

1.10.2.2 Eavesdropping
As a result of the large coverage of a geostationary satellite, it may
be easy for an eavesdropper to receive a downlink carrier and access
the information content by demodulating the carrier. Therefore,
to prevent unauthorised use of the information conveyed on the
carrier, encryption may be mandatory.

1.10.2.3 Loss of transponder may lead to loss of network
The satellite is a single point failure. Should the transponder that
relays the carrier fail, then the complete VSAT network is out
of order. Communication links can be restored by using a spare
transponder. With a spare colocated on the same satellite, a mere
change in frequency or polarisation puts the network back in

46

INTRODUCTION

operation. However, should this transponder be located on another
satellite, this may mean intervening on each site to repoint the
antenna, and this may take some time.

1.10.2.4 Propagation delay (double hop = 0 .5 s)
The propagation time from remote to remote in a star-shaped
network imposes a double hop with its associated delay of about
half a second. This may prevent the use of voice communications,
at least with commercial standards.

2
Use of satellites for VSAT
networks
It is not so important for someone who is interested in VSAT networks to know a lot about satellites. However, a number of factors
relative to satellite orbiting and satellite–earth geometry inﬂuence
the operation and performance of VSAT networks. For instance,
the relative position of the satellite with respect to the VSAT at
a given instant determines the orientation of the VSAT antenna
and also the carrier propagation delay value. The relative velocity
of the satellite with respect to the earth station receiving equipment induces Doppler shifts on the carrier frequency that must be
tracked and compensated for. This impacts on the speciﬁcations
and the design of earth station receivers. For a geostationary satellite, which is supposed to be in a ﬁxed position relative to the
earth, one may believe that once the antenna has been properly
pointed towards that position at the time of its installation, the
adequate orientation is established once and for all. Actually, as
a result of satellite orbital perturbations, there is no such thing
as a geostationary satellite, and residual motions induce antenna
depointing and hence antenna gain losses which affect the link
performance.
Therefore it is worth mentioning these aspects, and this is the aim
of this chapter. Orbit deﬁnition and parameters will be presented
in the general case, with the ulterior motive to give the reader
some conceptual tools that would be handy should VSAT networks
be used someday in conjunction with non-geostationary satellite
systems. However, as current VSAT networks use geostationary
satellites, the bulk of the chapter will consider this speciﬁc scenario.

USE OF SATELLITES FOR VSAT NETWORKS

Many of the considerations developed in this chapter will be used
in the following ones.
Before orbital aspects are dealt with, the role of the satellite and
some related topics will ﬁrst be introduced as an encouragement to
the reader.

2.1

INTRODUCTION

2.1.1

The relay function

Satellites relay the carriers transmitted by earth stations on the
ground to other earth stations, as illustrated in Figure 2.1. Therefore,
satellites act similarly to microwave terrestrial relays installed on the
tops of hills or mountains to facilitate long distance radio frequency
links. Here the satellite, being at a much higher altitude than any
terrestrial relay, is able to link distant earth stations, even from
continent to continent.
Figure 2.1 indicates that the earth stations are part of what is called
the ground segment, while the satellite is part of the space segment.

The space segment also comprises all the means to operate the
satellite, for instance the stations which monitor the satellite status
by means of telemetry links and control it by means of command
links. Such links are sometimes called TTC (telemetry, tracking and
command) links.
The satellite roughly consists of a platform and a payload. The
platform consists of all subsystems that allow the payload to function
properly, namely:
– the mechanical structure which supports all equipment in the
satellite;
– the electric power supply, consisting of the solar panels and the
batteries used as supply during eclipses of the sun by the earth
and the moon;
– the attitude and orbit control, with sensors and actuators;
– the propulsion subsystem;
– the onboard TTC equipment.
The payload comprises the satellite antennas and the electronic
equipment for amplifying the uplink carriers. These carriers are also
frequency converted to the frequency of the downlink. Frequency
conversion avoids unacceptable interference between uplinks and
downlinks.
Figure 2.2 shows the general architecture of the payload. The
receiver (Rx) encompasses a wide band ampliﬁer and a frequency
downconverter. The input multiplexer (IMUX) splits the incoming
carriers into groups within several sub-bands, each group being
ampliﬁed to the power level required for transmission by a high
transponders

power ampliﬁer, generally a travelling wave tube (TWT). The different groups of carriers are then combined in the output multiplexer
(OMUX) and forwarded to the transmitting antenna. The channels
associated with the subbands of the payload from IMUX to OMUX
are called transponders. The advantage of splitting the satellite band
is three-fold:
– each transponder TWT ampliﬁes a reduced set of carriers, hence
each carrier beneﬁts from a larger share of the limited amount of
power available at the output of the TWT;
– the transponder TWT operates in a non-linear mode when driven
near saturation. Saturation is desirable because the TWT then
delivers more power to the ampliﬁed carriers than when operated in a backed-off mode, away from saturation. However,
amplifying multiple carriers in a non-linear mode generates
intermodulation, which acts as transmitted noise on the downlink. Less intermodulation noise power is transmitted with a
reduced set of ampliﬁed carriers within each TWT;
– reliability is increased, as the failure of one TWT does not imply
an overall satellite failure and each TWT can be backed up.
Typical values of bandwidth for a transponder are 36 MHz,
45 MHz and 72 MHz. However, there is no established standard.
The TWT power is typically a few tens of watts. Some satellites are
now equipped with solid state power ampliﬁers (SSPAs) instead
of TWTs.
Figure 2.2 does not indicate any back-up equipment. To ensure the
required reliability at the end of life of the satellite, some redundancy
is built into the payload: for instance, the receiver is usually backed
up with a redundant unit, which can be switched on in case of
failure of the allocated receiver. The transponders are also backed
up by a number of redundant units: a popular scheme is the ring
redundancy, where each IMUX output can be connected to any
of several transponders, with a similar arrangement between the
transponder outputs and the OMUX inputs.

2.1.2

Transparent and regenerative payload

A satellite payload is transparent when the carrier is ampliﬁed
and frequency downconverted without being demodulated. The
frequency conversion is then performed by means of a mixer and a
local oscillator as indicated in Figure 2.3. The carrier at a frequency
equal to the uplink frequency fU minus the local oscillator frequency

to IMUX

fU

Figure 2.3

Receiver for a transparent satellite

fLO is usually selected by ﬁltering at the output of the mixer, and the
local oscillator frequency is tuned so that the resulting frequency
corresponds to the desired downlink frequency fD . For instance,
an uplink carrier at frequency fU = 14.25 GHz mixed with a local
oscillator frequency fLO = 1.55 GHz results in a downlink carrier
frequency fD = 12.7 GHz.
A transparent payload makes no distinction between uplink
carrier and uplink noise, and both signals are forwarded to the
downlink. Therefore, at the earth station receiver, one gets the
downlink noise together with the uplink retransmitted noise.
A regenerative payload entails on-board demodulation of the
uplink carriers. On-board regeneration is most conveniently performed on digital carriers. The bit stream obtained from demodulation of a given uplink carrier is then used to modulate a new
carrier at downlink frequency. This carrier is noise-free, hence a
regenerative payload does not retransmit the uplink noise on the
downlink. The overall link quality is therefore improved. Moreover,
intermodulation noise can be avoided as the satellite channel ampliﬁer is no longer requested to operate in a multicarrier mode. Indeed,
several bit streams at the output of various demodulators can be
combined into a time division multiplex (TDM) which modulates
a single high rate downlink carrier. This carrier is ampliﬁed by the
channel ampliﬁer which can be operated at saturation without generating intermodulation noise as the carrier it ampliﬁes is unique.
This concept is illustrated in Figure 2.4.
It should be emphasised that today’s commercial satellites which
can be used for VSAT services are not equipped with regenerative
payloads but only with transparent ones. Only a few experimental
satellites such as NASA’s Advanced Communications Technology
Satellite (ACTS) and the italian ITALSAT satellite have incorporated
a regenerative payload, but they are no longer in operation. Some
satellites of the EUTELSAT ﬂeet are equipped with a regenerative
payload (Skyplex) but can be used only by earth stations operating
according to the DVB-S standard.

Coverage

The coverage of a satellite payload is determined by the radiation
pattern of its antennas. The receiving antenna and the transmitting
antenna may have different patterns and hence there may be a
different coverage for the uplink and the downlink. The coverage is
usually deﬁned by a speciﬁed minimum value of the antenna gain:
for instance, the 3 dB coverage corresponds to the area deﬁned by a
contour of constant gain value 3 dB lower than the maximum gain
value at antenna boresight. This contour deﬁnes the edge of coverage.
There are four types of coverage:
– Global coverage: the pattern of the antenna illuminates the largest
possible portion of the earth surface as viewed from the satellite
(Figure 2.5). A geostationary satellite sees the earth with an angle
equal to 17.4◦ . Selecting the beamwidth of the antenna as 17.4◦
imposes a maximum gain at boresight of 20 dBi, thus the gain at
the edge of the −3 dB coverage is 17 dBi.
– Zone coverage: an area smaller than the global coverage area is
illuminated (Figure 2.6). The coverage area may have a simple

shape (circle or ellipse) or a more complex shape (contoured
beam). For a typical zone coverage the antenna beamwidth is
of the order of 5◦ . This imposes a maximum gain at boresight
of 30 dBi, and a gain at the edge of the −3 dB coverage of
27 dBi.
– Spot beam coverage: an area much smaller than the global coverage
area is illuminated. The antenna beamwidth is of the order of
one to two degrees (Figure 2.7). Considering a 1.7◦ beamwidth
imposes a maximum gain at boresight of 40 dBi and a gain at the
edge of the −3 dB coverage of 37 dBi.
– Multibeam coverage: a spot beam coverage has the advantage of
higher antenna gain than any other type of coverage previously
discussed, but it can service only the limited zone within its
coverage area. A service zone larger than the coverage area of
a spot beam can still be serviced with high antenna gain thanks

to a multibeam coverage made of several individual spot beams.
An example of such a coverage with adjacent spot beams is
shown in Figure 2.8. This requires a multibeam satellite payload
with more complex antenna farms. Maintaining interconnectivity between all stations of the service zone also implies a more
complex payload architecture than that considered in Figure 2.2.
Interconnectivity between stations implies that beams are interconnected; this can be achieved either by permanent connections
from the uplink beams to the downlink ones, as illustrated in
Figure 2.9, or by temporary connections established through an
on-board switching matrix, as shown in Figure 2.10.
Permanent connections entail a larger number of transponders
than on-board switching. On-board satellite switching requires that

earth stations transmit bursts of carriers, synchronous to the satellite
switch state sequence, in such a way that they arrive at the satellite
exactly when the proper uplink beam to downlink beam connection
is established. More details on the operation of such multibeam
satellite systems can be found in [MAR02, Chapter 7].
Usually the extension of a VSAT network is small enough for all
VSATs and the hub station to be located within one beam.

carriers. As will be demonstrated in Chapter 5, the ability of the
satellite payload to receive uplink carriers is measured by the ﬁgure
of merit G/T of the satellite receiver, and its ability to transmit
is measured by its effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). These
characteristics are deﬁned in more detail in Chapter 5. Basically, G/T
is the ratio of the receiving satellite antenna gain to the uplink system
noise temperature, and the EIRP is the product of the transmitting
satellite antenna gain GT and the power PT fed to the antenna by the
transponder ampliﬁer. Therefore, both parameters are proportional
to the satellite antenna gain.
The speciﬁed values of G/T and EIRP are to be considered at the
edge of coverage. Usually the edge of coverage is deﬁned by the
contour on the earth corresponding to a constant satellite antenna
gain, say 3 dB below the gain Gmax at boresight.
Now the maximum satellite antenna gain, Gmax , as obtained at
boresight, is inversely proportional to the square of its half power

From (2.2) and (2.1), it can be seen that the speciﬁed values of G/T

G/T and EIRP.
So, the coverage of the satellite inﬂuences its relaying performance in terms of G/T and EIRP. A global coverage leads to
smaller values of satellite G/T and EIRP, compared to a spot
beam coverage. Should the VSAT network be included in a single satellite beam, then the larger its geographical dispersion, the
poorer the satellite performance: this has to be compensated for
by installing larger VSATs. For networks comprised of highly dispersed VSATs, say spread over several continents, the advantages
of simple networking in terms of easy interconnectivity by placing all VSATs within a single beam have to be weighed against
the cost of increasing the size of the VSATs, which might not be
necessary if one agrees to service the network with a multibeam
satellite, at the expense, however, of a more complex network
operation.

2.1.5

Frequency reuse

Frequency reuse consists of using the same frequency band several
times in such a way as to increase the total capacity of the network
without increasing the allocated bandwidth. Frequency reuse can
be achieved within a given beam by using polarisation diversity:
two carriers at the same frequency but with orthogonal polarisations can be discriminated by the receiving antenna according to
their respective polarisation. With multibeam satellites the isolation
resulting from antenna directivity can be exploited to reuse the same
frequency band in different beams.

Figure 2.11 compares the principle of frequency reuse by orthogonal polarisation (Figure 2.11(a)) and the principle of frequency reuse
by angular beam separation (Figure 2.11(b)). In both cases the bandwidth allocated to the system is B. The system uses this bandwidth
B centred on frequency fU for the uplink and on the frequency
fD for the downlink. In the case of frequency reuse by orthogonal
polarisation, the bandwidth B can only be reused twice. In the case
of reuse by angular separation, the bandwidth B can be reused for
as many beams as the permissible interference level allows. Both
types of frequency reuse can be combined.

USE OF SATELLITES FOR VSAT NETWORKS

From Newton’s law, the following results can be derived, which
actually were formulated prior to Newton’s works by Kepler
from his observation of the movement of the planets around
the sun:
– the trajectory of the satellite in space, called the orbit, lies in
a plane containing the centre of the earth. For communication
satellites, the orbit is selected to be an ellipse and one focus is
the centre of the earth. Should the orbit be circular, then the orbit
centre coincides with the earth centre;
– the vector from the centre of the earth to the satellite sweeps
equal areas in equal times;
– the period T of revolution of the satellite around the earth is
given by:
T = 2π(a3 /µ)1/2 (seconds)

Orbital parameters

in space (Figure 2.12) [MAR02, Figure 2.4, p 32]:

– one parameter for positioning the orbit in its plane: the argument
of the perigee (ω);
– two parameters for the shape of the orbit: the semi-major axis
(a) of the ellipse, and its eccentricity (e);
– one parameter for the positioning of the satellite on the elliptic
curve: the true anomaly (v).

2.2.2.1 Plane of the orbit (Figure 2.13)
The plane of the orbit is obtained by rotating the earth’s equatorial
plane about the line of nodes of the orbit. The nodes are the intersections of the orbit with the equatorial plane of the earth. There is one
ascending node where the satellite crosses the equatorial plane from
south to north, and one descending node where the satellite crosses
the equatorial plane from north to south. The rotation angle about
the line of nodes is i, deﬁned as the inclination of the orbital plane. This
angle is counted positively in the forward direction between 0◦ and
180◦ between the normal n1 (directed towards the east) to the line of
nodes in the equatorial plane, and the normal n2 (in the direction of
the satellite velocity) to the line of nodes in the orbital plane.
The line of nodes must be referenced to some ﬁxed direction in
the equatorial plane. The commonly used reference direction is the
line of intersection of the earth’s equatorial plane with the plane
of the ecliptic, which is the orbital plane of the earth around the
sun (Figure 2.14). This line maintains a ﬁxed direction in space with
time, called the direction of the vernal point γ . Actually, as a result
of some irregularities in the rotation of the earth, with the earth
axis experiencing nutation, the direction of the vernal point is not
perfectly ﬁxed with time. Therefore the reference direction is taken
as the direction of the vernal point at some instant, usually noon

direction of the line of nodes is the right ascension of the ascending
node Ω. It is counted positively from 0◦ to 360◦ in the forward
direction in the equatorial plane about the earth axis.

2.2.2.2 Positioning the orbit in its plane (Figure 2.15)
The centre of the earth is one of the focuses of the elliptical orbit.
Therefore, the major axis of the ellipse passes through the centre of
the earth. The direction of the perigee in the plane of the orbit is
determined by the argument of the perigee ω, which is the angle, with
vertex at the centre of the earth, taken positively from 0◦ to 360◦ in
the direction of the motion of the satellite between the direction of
the ascending node and the direction of the perigee. The perigee is
the point of the orbit that is nearest to the centre of the earth. At
the opposite of the major axis is the apogee, which is the point of the
orbit that is farthest from the centre of the earth.

THE GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE
Orbit parameters

A geostationary satellite proceeds in a circular orbit (e = 0) in the
equatorial plane (i = 0◦ ). The angular velocity of the satellite is the
same as that of the earth, and in the same direction (direct orbit), as
illustrated in Figure 1.5. To a terrestrial observer, the satellite seems
to be ﬁxed in the sky.
The above conditions make the period of the circular orbit, T,
equal to the duration of a sidereal day, that is the time it takes for
the earth to rotate 360◦ . Hence T = 23 h 56 min 4 s = 86 164 s. From
expression (2.4) one can calculate the semi-major axis, a, of the orbit
which identiﬁes the radius of the orbit. One obtains a = 42 164 km.
Subtracting from this value the earth radius Re = 6378 km, one
obtains the satellite altitude Ro = a − Re = 35 786 km. The satellite
velocity Vs can be calculated from expression (2.7) selecting r = a. It
results in Vs = 3075 ms−1 .
Table 2.1 summarises the characteristics of a geostationary satellite orbit.

2.3.2

Launching the satellite

The principle of launching a satellite into orbit is to provide it with
the appropriate velocity at a speciﬁc point of its trajectory in the
plane of the orbit, starting from the launching base on the earth
surface. This usually requires a launch vehicle for the take-off, and
an on-board speciﬁc propulsion system.
With a geostationary satellite, the desired orbit is circular, in the
equatorial plane, and it is attained by an intermediate orbit called
the transfer orbit. This is an elliptical orbit with perigee at an altitude

of about 200 km, and apogee at the altitude of the geostationary
orbit (35 786 km). Most conventional launch vehicles (Ariane, Delta,
Atlas Centaur) inject the satellite into the transfer orbit at its perigee,
as shown in Figure 2.18.
At this point, the launch vehicle must communicate a velocity
Vp = 10 234 m/s−1 to the satellite (for a perigee at 200 km). Then
the satellite is left to itself and proceeds forward in the transfer
orbit. When arriving at the apogee of the transfer orbit, the satellite
propulsion system is activated and a velocity impulse is given to
the satellite. This increases its velocity to the required velocity for a
geostationary orbit, that is Vs = 3075 ms−1 . The satellite orbit is now
circular, and the satellite has the proper altitude.
Note the advantage of a launch towards the east as the launch
vehicle beneﬁts from the velocity introduced into the trajectory by
the rotation of the earth.

In practice, there are some slight deviations to the above procedure:
1. The launch base may not be in the equatorial plane. The launch
vehicle follows a trajectory in a plane which contains the centre
of the earth and the launch base (Figure 2.19). The inclination
of the orbit is thus greater than or equal to the latitude of the
launching base, unless the trajectory is made non-planar, but this
would induce mechanical constraints and an additional expense
of energy. So the normal procedure is to have it planar. Should
the launch base not be on the Equator, then the transfer orbit
and the ﬁnal geostationary satellite orbit are not in the same
plane, and an inclination correction has to be performed. This
correction requires a velocity increment to be applied as the
satellite passes through one of the nodes of the orbit such that
the resultant velocity vector, Vs , is in the plane of the Equator,
as indicated in Figure 2.20. For a given inclination correction, the

velocity impulse ∆V to be applied increases with the velocity VA
of the satellite. The correction is thus performed at the apogee
of the transfer orbit where VA is minimum, at the same time as
circularisation.
2. A precise determination of the transfer orbit parameters requires
trajectory tracking during several orbits. Hence, the satellite
propulsion system is activated only after several transfer orbit
periods.
3. The injection into geostationary orbit does not necessarily take
place in the meridian plane of the earth where the geostationary
satellite is to be positioned for operation. To reach this position, a
relative non-zero small angular velocity between the satellite and
the earth must be kept so that the satellite undergoes a longitudinal drift. This leads to injecting the satellite from transfer orbit into
a circular orbit, called drift orbit, with a slightly different altitude
than that of geostationary satellite orbit. Once the satellite has
reached the intended station longitude, a correction is initiated
by activating the thrusters of the satellite orbit control system.

2.3.3

Distance to the satellite

The distance from an earth station to the satellite impacts on the
propagation time of the radio frequency carrier and hence on the
delay for information delivery (see Chapter 4, section 4.6.6). It also
determines the path loss which intervenes in the link budget calculation (see Chapter 5).

station with respect to the satellite.

direction as the satellite. As the earth station antenna is pointed
towards the satellite, it now becomes also pointed towards the sun.
The antenna captures the radio frequency power radiated by the
sun and this increases the noise at the antenna. The antenna noise
increase is discussed in section 3.3.10.
As the satellite rotates along with the earth, conjunction of the
satellite and the sun is a momentary event. It is predictable and
actually happens twice per year for several minutes over a period
of ﬁve or six days [MAR02, Chapter 2]:
– before the spring equinox and after the autumn equinox for a
station in the northern hemisphere;
– after the spring equinox and before the autumn equinox for a
station in the southern hemisphere.

2.3.6

Orbit perturbations

Actually, a geostationary satellite does not exist: indeed, Newton’s
law considers an attracting force exerted on the satellite by a point
mass, and oriented towards that point mass. Actually, the earth is
not a point mass, there are other attracting bodies apart from the
earth, and other forces than attraction forces are exerted on the
satellite. These effects result in orbit perturbations.

USE OF SATELLITES FOR VSAT NETWORKS

71

For a geostationary satellite, the major perturbations originate in:
– the earth neither being a point mass nor being rotationally symmetric: this produces an asymmetry of the gravitational potential;
– the presence of the sun and the moon as other attracting bodies;
– the radiation pressure from the sun, which produces forces on
the surfaces of the satellite body facing the sun.
These effects are discussed in detail in [MAR02, Chapter 2]. The
practical consequences are summarised below:
– the asymmetry of the gravitational potential generates a longitudinal drift of the satellite depending on its station longitude.
Actually, there are four equilibrium positions around the earth
where this drift is zero, two of which are stable (at 102◦ longitude
west and 76◦ longitude east) and two unstable (at 11◦ longitude
west and 164◦ longitude east). Left to itself, a geostationary satellite would undergo an oscillatory longitudinal drift about the

– the attraction of the moon and the sun modiﬁes the inclination of
the orbit at a rate of about 0.8◦ per year;
– the radiation pressure from the sun creates a force which acts
in the direction of the velocity of the satellite on one half of the
orbit and in the opposite direction on the other half. In this way
the circular orbit of a geostationary satellite tends to become
elliptical, as illustrated in Figure 2.24.
The ellipticity of the orbit does not increase constantly: with the
movement of the earth about the sun, since the apsidial line of
the satellite orbit remains perpendicular to the direction of the
sun, the ellipse deforms continuously and the eccentricity remains
within limits.

2.3.7

Apparent satellite movement

2.3.7.1 Effect of non-zero inclination
The track on the earth of a geostationary satellite with non-zero
inclination displays a ‘ﬁgure of eight’ with a 24-hour period, as
indicated in Figure 2.25.
This can be understood by considering that the satellite is at its
nominal position in the equatorial plane when it passes through the
nodes of the orbit, then proceeds on a trajectory that is above the
equatorial plane from the ascending node to the descending node
and below the equatorial plane from the descending node to the
ascending node. This explains the north–south component of the
‘ﬁgure of eight’. The longitudinal component can be understood
by observing that the projection B of the satellite on the equatorial
plane, as illustrated in Figure 2.26 by the dotted curve, does not
have the constant angular velocity of the point A which is subjected

to the constant angular velocity of the satellite in its orbit. There is
consequently an apparent east–west movement of the satellite with
respect to the reference meridian on the surface of the earth (that of
the satellite on passing through the nodes).
The latitudinal variation corresponding to the amplitude of the
ﬁgure of eight above or below the Equator is equal to the inclination
angle i, and the maximum longitudinal variation with respect to the
reference meridian is equal to 4.36 × 10−3 i2 (all values in degrees).
Therefore for small inclination values, say 0.1◦ , the ﬁgure of eight

74

USE OF SATELLITES FOR VSAT NETWORKS

can be considered to reduce to a north–south oriented segment,
with latitudinal extent from +i degrees to −i degrees.
The transformation of the track of the satellite from a dot on
the Equator for a perfect geostationary satellite to a north–south
oriented segment about this dot for a slightly inclined orbit translates
into an apparent movement of the satellite in the sky as viewed from
the earth station. This apparent movement leads to a 24-hour period
variation of the elevation angle for a station located in the meridian
of the nominal satellite meridian, and of the azimuth angle for a
station located on the Equator east or west of the satellite. For any
other station the apparent motion leads to a combined variation of
both elevation and azimuth angles.

2.3.7.2 Effect of non-zero eccentricity
Figure 2.27 illustrates the effect of non-zero eccentricity: the successive positions of two satellites are represented. One is in a circular
orbit, and the other is in an elliptical orbit of the same period.
The subsatellite point remains in the equatorial plane and displays a 24-hour period oscillation about its nominal position when
the satellite is at perigee or apogee. It can be shown that for
small eccentricity values, as considered here, typically less than
0.001, the maximum longitudinal amplitude of the oscillation is
114e degrees, where e is the value of the eccentricity [MAR02,
Chapter 2].

2.3.7.3 Effect of east–west drift
The east–west drift of the satellite induces a similar drift of the
subsatellite point. This drift is oscillatory and periodic about the
nearest point of stable equilibrium. The period and the amplitude
of the longitudinal oscillation can be fairly large as indicated by
Figure 2.23. Therefore, the apparent movement of the satellite is to
be considered as a long-term movement compared to the previously
discussed movements.

2.3.7.4 Combined effects
As a consequence of perturbations, the satellite displays an apparent
movement in the sky relative to its nominal position. This apparent
movement is the resultant of the combined effects of oscillations of
period 24 h due to the non-zero inclination (north–south oriented
oscillations) and non-zero eccentricity (east–west oriented oscillations) and the long-term drift of the mean longitude (east–west
oriented drift). For an earth station, the apparent movement translates into variations of the elevation and azimuth angles with a
24-hour periodic component superimposed on a long-term drift.
Figure 2.28 gives an example of such variations.

USE OF SATELLITES FOR VSAT NETWORKS

Orbit corrections

2.3.8.1 Station keeping box
It is mandatory to take corrective actions to prevent the satellite
from straying away from its nominal position in the Equator in
a given earth meridian. These corrective actions are part of the
so-called ‘station keeping’ procedures. The objective is to maintain
the satellite within a station keeping box, which is deﬁned as
the volume in space represented in Figure 2.29. This side of the
box viewed from the earth centre is called the station keeping
window.
The station keeping window is deﬁned by two angles at the
earth centre which limit the maximum excursions of the satellite
in longitude and latitude: one within the equatorial plane, the
other in the satellite meridian. The maximum value of the residual
eccentricity determines the overshoot of the radial distance. The
indicated dimensions of the box in Figure 2.29 correspond to a
typical window speciﬁcation of ±0.05◦ in longitude and latitude,
and a residual eccentricity of 0.0004.

2.3.8.2 Correction procedures
To maintain the satellite within the box, orbit corrections are
achieved by applying velocity impulses to the satellite at a point in
the orbit. These impulses are generated by activating the thrusters
that are mounted on the satellite as part of the propulsion subsystem. The satellite can be kept at station as long as there is enough
propellant left for the thrusts to be produced. When no propellant
is left, the satellite drifts in space out of control. This is the end of
its operational life. To avoid a possible collision with other geostationary satellites, satellite operators usually keep some amount of

propellant for generating a ﬁnal impulse that positions the satellite
into an orbit sufﬁciently far away from the trajectories followed by
its geostationary neighbours.
There is a tendency today, among satellite operators, to relax
the north–south speciﬁcation of the station keeping window. This
allows substantial propellent savings, and therefore satellite lifetime
extension. However, this results in a higher depointing loss for ﬁxed
mounted antennas on the ground (see Chapter 5, section 5.2).

2.3.9

Doppler effect

The Doppler effect is a change in the receive frequency with respect
to the transmit frequency as a result of a non-zero velocity of the
transmitter relative to the receiver. If the transmitter transmits at a
frequency f , the frequency received by the receiver is f ± ∆f . The
frequency shift ∆f is given by:
fVr
(Hz)
(2.11)
c
where Vr is the absolute value of the relative velocity of the receiver
with respect to the transmitter and c is the speed of light (c =
3 × 108 ms−1 ).
Communications with geostationary satellites experience a small
Doppler effect as a result of the movement of the satellite within
its station keeping window. With non-regenerative satellites, the
Doppler effect acts twice: once on the uplink, with value ∆fU , and
a second time on the downlink with value ∆fD , so the maximum
overall frequency shift ∆fT,max at the receiving earth station is
given by:
(fU + fD )Vr
(Hz)
(2.12)
∆fT,max =
c
A typical maximum value for the satellite relative velocity Vr,max
is 10 km/h−1 , i.e. 3 ms−1 , so this generates a maximum frequency
shift ∆fT,max with respect to the transmitted carrier typically equal to
100 Hz at C-band and 260 Hz at Ku-band. This must be accounted
for in the design of demodulators, especially at low data rate (a few
kbs−1 ), by implementing carrier recovery devices with the ability to
track the carrier over the expected frequency span.
∆f =

First the satellite must be positioned at a longitude where it is
visible from any earth station in the network. The longitude of
existing satellites can be obtained from the ITU, but the documents
identify the registered satellites, many of which may not yet be
or may never become operational. Apart from the ITU, relevant
information can be obtained from the websites of satellite operators.
Then the elevation angle should be computed for extreme stations
and checks made that it is large enough (10◦ is a minimum value in
open areas).
Second, the satellite coverage should be matched to the network
geographical extension. So further investigation should include
examination of maps indicating contours at constant EIRP (effective
isotropic radiated power) and G/T (receiving ﬁgure of merit). As
such contours correspond to constant satellite antenna gain, the
achieved values are dependent on the type of coverage: a global
coverage offers a worse link performance than zone or spot beam
coverage. Candidate satellites should be selected upon the minimum
required values of the EIRP and G/T which allow the requested link
performance.
Third, a check of all station pointing angles (azimuth and elevation) should be performed for all planned sites in such a way that
no obstacles prevent the earth station from accessing the satellite,
once installed.
Finally, the selection procedure includes negotiations related to
regulatory and ﬁnancial matters.
Table 2.2 indicates typical values of EIRP and G/T for geostationary satellites, depending on the type of coverage and frequency bands.

Operational aspects
This chapter aims to provide a survey of the main items to be
considered when installing and operating a VSAT network. Installation is considered ﬁrst. Then the user’s most obvious concerns
are discussed.

3.1
3.1.1

INSTALLATION
Hub

As the hub is relatively large, the installation of it is relatively
complex and expensive. Civil works may be necessary. Typically, it
takes between one and four weeks to install a hub station depending
on its size and the selected site. This does not include on-site testing
of the equipment.

3.1.2

VSAT

The major problem with VSAT installation is that it involves potentially hundreds of remote VSAT locations with a very wide variety
of users, landlords, site conditions, and local zoning requirements.
VSATs can be roof mounted (Figure 3.1), wall mounted (Figure
3.2) or ground mounted (Figure 3.3). A non-penetrating roof mount
makes use of an angle iron frame covered in concrete slabs. The
antenna support tube is held vertical by several angled braces.
A penetrating roof mount is ﬁxed to a horizontal surface using
expansion bolts or chemical ﬁxings (bolts that are permanently

‘glued’ into holes made in the surface using epoxy resin). Wall
mounting makes use of plates or assemblies of struts designed to
be ﬁxed on the face of a wall, or on the inside corner of two walls.
Ground mounting involves a tube lowered into a hole which is then
ﬁlled in with concrete. Alternatively, the tube may have a base plate

attached so that it may be screwed to a plain concrete base using
expanding bolts or similar. When ground mounted, the VSAT is
best secured with fences (Figure 3.3) to prevent people or animals
from getting hurt or damaging the outdoor unit. However, fences
are not a strong protection against vandalism.
A typical VSAT installation generally requires three visits to each
site: a site survey, basic site preparation, equipment installation and
test. About 20% of the sites will require an installation revisit.
The following ﬁgures may be used for installation planning: the
average VSAT cable run is 60 metres, 30% of VSATs are ground
mounted, 70% roof mounted. Possibly 15% of roof mounts require
special engineering.

3.1.3

Antenna pointing

Accurate antenna pointing is paramount for transmitting and receiving maximum power to and from the satellite the earth station
antenna aims at. At least two angles need to be considered in the
pointing procedure:
– the azimuth angle, Az;
– the elevation angle, E.
If the transmission is based on linearly polarised carriers, a third
angle should be considered: the polarisation angle, ψ.

82

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS

Figure 3.4 introduces the azimuth angle and the elevation angle:
– the azimuth angle, Az, is the rotation angle about a vertical axis
through the earth station counted clockwise from the geographical north, which brings the antenna boresight into the vertical
plane that contains the satellite. This plane contains the centre of
the earth, the earth station and the satellite. The value of Az is
obtained by means of an intermediate parameter, a, determined
from the family of curves of Figure 3.5 and used to calculate Az
according to the table shown in the ﬁgure [SMI72]. The curves
are obtained from the following expression which can be used
for greater accuracy:


tan L
(degrees)
(3.1)
a = arc tan
sin l
where l is the geographical latitude of the earth station and L is the
absolute difference between the longitude of the satellite and the
longitude of the earth station.
– the elevation angle E is the rotation angle about a horizontal axis
perpendicular to the above-mentioned vertical plane counted
from 0◦ to 90◦ from the horizontal, which brings the antenna
boresight in the direction of the satellite. The elevation angle is
obtained from the corresponding family of curves of Figure 3.5
which correspond to the following expression:
E = arc tan[(cos Φ − Re /(Re + Ro ))/(1 − cos2 Φ)1/2 ] (degrees)
(3.2)
where:
cos Φ = cos l cos L
Re = radius of the earth = 6378 km
Ro = altitude of the satellite = 35 786 km
Expressions (3.1) and (3.2), or Figures 3.4 and 3.5 can be used for a
coarse orientation of the antenna. The azimuth angle is deﬁned from
the geographic north while the magnetic north is given by a compass
used on the site. The difference is the magnetic declination, the value
of which depends on the site location and the year. The elevation
angle must be measured from the horizon, which is deﬁned by the
local horizontal plane and easily determined from a spirit level.
At Ku-band the polarisation of the wave received from the satellite
is most often linear, and the earth station antenna feed must have
its polarisation aligned with the polarisation plane of the received

wave. This plane contains the electric ﬁeld of the wave. The polarisation plane at the satellite is deﬁned by the satellite antenna boresight
and a reference direction. This reference direction is, for instance, the
perpendicular to the equatorial plane for vertical polarisation (VP)
or parallel to the plane of the Equator for horizontal polarisation
(HP). The polarisation angle at the earth station is the angle ψ between
the plane deﬁned by the local vertical at the earth station and the
antenna boresight, and the polarisation plane. ψ = 0 corresponds to
the reception or emission at the earth station of a linearly polarised
wave with its polarisation plane containing the local vertical. The
polarisation angle at the earth station for a reference direction at the
satellite in a plane perpendicular to the equatorial plane is given
by [MAR02 p391]:
sin l
cos ψ = 
(1 − cos2 l cos2 L)

(3.3)

where l and L are deﬁned as in (3.1). Figure 3.6(a) displays absolute
values of the polarisation angle ψ according to equation (3.3). The
feed of the antenna should be rotated from the vertical by an angle
ψ either clockwise or counterclockwise when facing the antenna
dish, depending on the location of the earth station (northern or
southern hemisphere) and its relative position with respect to the
satellite (eastward or westward). The sense of rotation is indicated
in Figure 3.6b.
Once coarse orientation has been achieved, a more precise orientation is performed according to maximisation of the power received
from a satellite beacon or a downlink carrier. For a large hub
equipped with a tracking antenna, the tracking equipment can be
activated and the orientation of the antenna will remain in the direction of the satellite within the precision of the tracking equipment,
whatever the subsequent motion of the satellite within its station
keeping window. The tracking error is of the order of 0.2 θ3dB ,
where θ3dB is the half power beamwidth of the earth station antenna
(see Appendix 4 for deﬁnition). Small hub stations and VSATs are
not equipped with a tracking antenna and the orientation of the
antenna will remain at its initial pointing, assuming that no severe
hazardous constraint acts upon the antenna equipment (e.g. a blow
or strong wind). Any subsequent motion of the satellite translates
into a depointing angle, and the corresponding loss of gain has to
be accounted for in the link margin. The maximum gain loss then
depends on the initial pointing error and the limits of the satellite
motion. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 5, section 5.2.

THE CUSTOMER’S CONCERNS

A VSAT network most often replaces an existing leased line data
network. The reasons for using VSAT services are, in order: cost
savings, ﬂexibility, reliability, data rates supported and no other
services meet needs. This section attempts to list some aspects to be
looked at when considering VSAT technology.

86

3.2.1

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS

Interfaces to end equipment

The indoor unit (IDU) is the part of the network most visible to
the user, as it is most often installed in his own ofﬁce. The IDU
is the terminating equipment of the VSAT network, to which the
user connects his own terminals. The IDU incorporates a number of input/output ports with speciﬁc connectors which must be
compatible with that of the user’s terminal.
With data networks, the customer wants to be able to use satellite
channels and VSATs in a manner which is transparent to existing
and future applications. Often the customer is interested in replacing
an existing network but he is usually not willing to replace current
equipment such as cluster controllers, front end processors, or
other data concentration devices, nor to change the interfaces to
that equipment. A customer may be reluctant even to reconﬁgure
the equipment by changing device addresses or the duration of
timers [EVE92, p 156–157]. Therefore, it is important that all physical
interfaces be software deﬁned and downline loadable from the
network management system (NMS) located at the hub station.
Modiﬁcations to individual operational interfaces within a VSAT
should not affect other operational interfaces at the same location.

3.2.2

Independence from vendor

The general functions of a VSAT network, as discussed in Chapter 1,
are the same across all vendor products. However, each VSAT has
a proprietary design and proprietary protocols. Therefore, VSAT
equipment from different vendors cannot share the same satellite
channels nor the same network hub equipment in the case of a star
network [EVE92, p 161].

3.2.3

Set-up time

This topic encompasses two aspects:
1. The time required to set up the network in a given initial conﬁguration: typically, it takes 90 days to implement a hundred
node network.
2. The time to expand the network by addition of new sites: a VSAT
can be added within a few days. This compares favourably with
several weeks waiting time for the installation of a terrestrial
leased line.

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS

87

With satellite news gathering (SNG), the VSAT can be installed
and in operation typically within twenty minutes.

3.2.4

Access to the service

Many VSAT networks are initially one way networks used, for
instance, for broadcasting of video. Most often, the customer then
wishes to upgrade the service into a two-way network for data
transmission. Alternatively, broadcast video is a cheap option once
the network is installed for data transmission.
It may be worthwhile for the network operator to ask the network
provider to perform installation tests prior to full deployment of
the network. This is an opportunity for equipment testing, and
also checking that the requested service is actually offered over
the subnetwork under test. At this point, the network provider can
proceed to trafﬁc measurements and check that the actual trafﬁc is
in conformity with design assumptions. Moreover, should the client
not be satisﬁed, the network can be turned down at little expense
compared to the cost of turning down the full network.

3.2.5

Flexibility

One of the main advantages of VSAT networks is that network
expansion, addition of new terminals and provision of new services can be accommodated without reconﬁguring or impacting the
operation of the rest of the network.
However, the performance of the network and hence the quality
of the service delivered to the user are sensitive to the amount
of trafﬁc, which increases as more and more terminals of VSATs
are added to the network. It is therefore important to allow spare
capacity in the space segment and the hub, typically 20% more trafﬁc
and 20% more VSATs than initially expected. Growth beyond initial
capacity must be orderly and modular. Considering that frequent
acquisitions and corporate restructuring are part of today’s business
world, it is important that the customer not be constrained on its
potential growth in telecommunication needs.

3.2.6

Failure and disaster recovery

As telecommunications are a sensitive part of a company’s ability
to support its business, the customer is concerned with the general

88

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS

feeling that satellite communications are risky by nature, as the network operation relies on a single satellite far away in space without
the possibility of repair. Most company managers have very little
natural conﬁdence in this telecommunications technology which is
unknown to them. It is therefore important to establish adequate
failure monitoring and diagnostic facilities, restoration procedures,
and consistent disaster recovery scenarios. The disaster scenario
should be adapted to the customer’s particular requirements.
Actions should include the following:
–
–
–
–

hub restoration;
VSAT restoration;
satellite back-up;
back-up terrestrial connections.

A hub failure may only affect some of the hub functions and still
allow a reduced capability in networking. Should the hub fail, or be
destroyed, to a point where the network suffers a complete breakdown, one may consider a properly equipped ﬁxed or transportable
earth station to resume immediate operations with no changes to
either the satellite or the VSATs. The shared hub option, presented
in Chapter 1, section 1.6.5, with its landline connections to the host
site, may be more prone to disaster. Further, with many users clamouring for service, priority for restoration could be a problem at the
shared hub. The shared hub operator must have a sound, tested
plan for such an occurrence.
The network management system (NMS) should perform a centralised failure identiﬁcation and diagnostic functions at each VSAT.
Failure to the card level should be detectable at the NMS. The failure
of a VSAT station implies an event which cannot be rectiﬁed by
commands and the downloading of parameters from the NMS. The
successful handling of failures requires accurate and timely detection of the fault. The inclusion of built-in test equipment (BITE) in the
VSAT station is essential to support this monitoring facility [EVE92,
p 202].
In case the failure threatens the network integrity, for example
if the impaired VSAT transmission would generate interference to
other links, there should be immediate termination of transmission
from that terminal. A solution is to implement a continuous hub
signal which is monitored by the VSAT. The VSAT automatically
stops its transmission when not receiving the hub signal.
Satellite failures are rare, but over the typical ﬁfteen year lifetime
of a satellite, one must be prepared to face some kind of failure.
Satellite depointing is the most probable event and results in a

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS

89

dramatic network breakdown. However, it normally takes no more
than a few hours to bring back the satellite to normal operation,
and the networking interruption is accounted for in the network
availability.
Transponder failure requires shifting the network to another
transponder on the same satellite. This possibility is highly dependent on the contractual conditions between the satellite operator and
the network operator: the satellite capacity may be leased either as
non preemptible or preemptible. Non-preemptible lease means that
the satellite operator warrants the use of the transponder bandwidth
and commits himself to do his best to offer the same bandwidth on
another transponder in case of failure of the leased one. Preemptible
means that the leased capacity cannot be guaranteed over time, and
the network operator may be asked to give back the used bandwidth
on request from the satellite operator.
Migrating to another transponder on the same satellite implies
changing the operating frequencies or polarisation of the entire
network. This must be planned in advance so that in case of signal
loss for a predetermined time, the VSAT could automatically tune
to a new frequency and a new polarisation plane and search for
signals from the hub. It should be possible to download the backup assignment of frequencies and polarisation from the network
management system (NMS) to take into account possible updating
of the back-up transponder scenario.
Finally, there exists a possibility for total satellite failure and
subsequent necessity to migrate to another satellite. This implies
repointing all remote VSAT antennas, which can be done manually
but takes time, especially with large networks, or automatically, but
at a higher cost per VSAT.
In any case, partial or complete breakdown of the network can
be avoided if back-up terrestrial connections are available. Should
a link be disrupted, the trafﬁc on that link can be routed automatically by automatic dial-up modems to a public, either circuit or
packet switched, terrestrial network. Figure 3.7 shows a possible
implementation for remote-to-host back-up interconnections.
The sensing of link failure and the automatic recovery via the terrestrial network increases the service availability. Vendors usually
offer such features.

Blocking probability

Blocking probability is considered in relation to demand assignment
operation, when the total number of VSATs registered in the network

possibly generates a trafﬁc demand that exceeds the capacity of the
network. When a station needs to establish a connection with another
or with the hub, it initiates a request to the network management
system (NMS), and this request is satisﬁed only if capacity is
available. If not, the call is blocked. Chapter 4, section 4.3 gives
means for determining the blocking probability. For VSAT networks
it ranges from 0.1% to 1%.

3.2.8

Response time

Response time is deﬁned as the time elapsed between emission of
speech and reception of the other talker’s response in the case of voice
telephony communications, or time elapsed between transmission
of an enquiry message initiated by pressing the return key of
the computer keyboard and the appearance of the ﬁrst character of
the response message on the computer screen.
Response time for data transfer builds up from several components:
– queuing time at the transmitting side as a result of possible delay
for capacity reservation before transmission occurs;

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS

91

– time for transmission of the emitted message which depends on
the length of the message and the transmission bit rate;
– propagation time which depends on the network architecture
and the number of satellite hops: for a single hop, the propagation
time is 0.25 s, and 0.5 s for a double hop. This propagation time
occurs on the ongoing link from transmitter to receiver and on
the return link;
– processing time of the enquiry message at the receiver, and time
necessary for generating and transmitting the response;
– protocol induced delay, as a result of error recovery and ﬂow
control between the transmitting site and the receiving one.
The VSAT network is only responsible for the routeing delay,
which includes propagation delay and processing delay, as a result
of protocol handshake between VSATs and hub front end processor,
but excludes the processing delay of the data terminal equipment.
A more detailed analysis of the origin of network delays is given
in Chapter 4, section 4.6.
Contrary to a well established belief, a VSAT network will very
likely result in a much better response time than the typical private
line network. The only physical limitation is the 0.5 second round
trip satellite transit delay. The issue then becomes one of cost: how
short does the response time really need to be?

3.2.9

Link quality

VSAT networks typically offer a bit error rate (BER) of 10−7 . This
guarantees an acceptable quality for digital voice and video. For data
communications, the bit error rate is not a signiﬁcant parameter, as
the transmission can be made error-free thanks to the retransmission
protocols that are usually implemented between end-to-end terminals. However, the bit error rate inﬂuences the number of required
retransmissions, and hence inﬂuences the delay.
As a result of the symmetry of all links, VSAT networks provide
the same service quality to each user. This may not be the case for
terrestrial networks.

3.2.10

Availability

In general terms, availability is deﬁned as the ratio of the time a unit
is properly functioning to the total time of usage:
A(%) =

100 (total usage time − down-time)
total usage time

(3.1)

92

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS

Network link availability is the percentage of time the service is
delivered at a given site with the requested quality (bit error rate
less than speciﬁed value, for instance one part in 107 , response
time within speciﬁed limits, for instance less than ﬁve seconds).
Network availability builds upon equipment reliability, propagation
impairments, and sun outage.
More precisely, network availability can be expressed as:
Anet = ATx Asat Alink ARx

(3.2)

where ATx is the transmitting earth station availability, Asat the space
segment availability, Alink the link availability, and ARx the receiving
station availability.
Table 3.1 gives some typical ﬁgures.
A 99.7% availability corresponds to a cumulated down-time of
26 hours per year. However, it is likely that the user will not accept a
service interruption lasting typically more than four hours in a row.
Should the service interruption be caused by equipment failure,
an appropriate maintenance procedure should be implemented to
restore the service within the requested time. Should propagation
impairments be responsible for the service interruption, then site
diversity can be considered. Finally, back-up terrestrial connections
may be a means to achieve service continuity.

3.2.10.1 Earth station availability (transmit or receive)
There are two aspects to this topic: (a) equipment failure; (b) antenna
depointing.
Equipment failure
A typical mean time between failures (MTBF) for an earth station
is 50 000 hours (6 years). The availability of a remote VSAT station
depends on the total repair time. This depends on how easy it
is to access the equipment. Spare parts are usually easy to get.

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS

93

Typically, the repair time is from a few hours to a few days. Hence,
availability per remote VSAT is typically 99.9% (9 hours per year
down-time). For a hub station where there is built-in redundancy,
the equipment availability is higher, typically 99.999% (ﬁve minutes
per year down-time).
Antenna depointing
This may happen as a result of severe mechanical constraints on
the antenna reﬂector, resulting from meteorological events such
as strong winds (storms, hurricanes) or heavy snowfall, where
wet snow or ice accumulates in the dish. Deicing devices reduce
the risk.

3.2.10.2 Space segment availability
There are two aspects to this topic:
– availability of capacity for coping with trafﬁc growth or unexpected demand for a variety of services;
– availability of other transponders should a transponder or the
entire satellite fail.
Availability of capacity in case of trafﬁc growth
The network operator should be aware of any available satellite
capacity in case he needs to expand. It may be good practice to have
spare capacity on the same satellite for occasional video once a data
network is operating.
Availability of capacity depends on the speciﬁc region of the
world, and varies with time. Truly, adapting the space segment
capacity to the demand is a severe challenge for satellite operators,
as estimating the demand and scheduling satellite launches to meet
the demand entails predictions over a period of ten to twenty years,
with the uncertainties associated with the spacecraft launching
schedule and success rate.
Transponder failure
Should the failed transponder be a non preemptible one, the network
can be transferred within hours to another transponder. The deal
is risk versus cost: the network operator may want to lease a nonpreemptible transponder with the warranty of being given capacity

94

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS

on another transponder in case of failure. But this costs more than a
preemptible transponder with no warranty at all. He then faces the
risk of being asked to disembark from his working transponder to
leave room for a customer on a failed non preemptible one.
Satellite failure
Should the entire satellite become useless, then one must transfer
the network to another satellite. This implies that one is available
in the same band, and with spare capacity. Transferring to this
satellite then imposes an intervention on each site to repoint each
antenna. This could take days to weeks, depending on the number
of sites. Alternatively, VSATs can be equipped with microprocessor
controlled, locally activated automatic repositioning mechanisms.
Pointing of the antenna then should be controlled both locally and
from the hub station.

3.2.10.3 Link availability
Availability requires that the link performance in terms of carrier
power to noise power spectral density, C/N0 , be larger than a given
value for the considered percentage of time. C/N0 varies according
to propagation effects (mainly rain fade) and sun transit (increase in
noise). These effects tend to decrease C/N0 below its required value
and cause link outage as illustrated in Figure 3.8.
Given a speciﬁc margin, C/N0 decreases with rain and sun transit,
and may become lower than the required value. C/N0 resumes
its value with margin when rain ceases or sun transit is over. The
down-time is smaller as the margin increases; hence, a larger margin
value leads to a higher link availability.

Rain fade
Rain is an issue at Ku-band and even more at Ka-band. It has little
effect at C-band. A quantitative discussion of rain effects is presented
in Chapter 5.
For voice and video services, reduction of C/N0 translates into
reduction of baseband signal quality (increase in bit error rate, or
reduction of baseband signal power to noise power ratio). In data
networks, as a result of the end-to-end protocol for error correction,
rain fade results in a gradually increasing response time and not a
precipitous failure.
An effective way to combat rain attenuation and reduce link
outage probability is site diversity [MAR02, Chapter 5]: this means
routeing information by either of two stations connected by terrestrial lines, depending on which station is less affected by rain
attenuation. The two stations must be sufﬁciently geographically
separated in order not to endure rain simultaneously. As large
rain attenuation is caused mostly by storms with limited extension, typically ten kilometres, site diversity is quite feasible with
VSAT networks, selecting an appropriate nearby VSAT station as
a back-up to the failed one. Some systems provide as an option
automatic dial-up in case of short term outage for rerouteing of the
ongoing connection to the diverse VSAT, via a terrestrial network
which will route data from the failed VSAT to the hub station.
Service is automatically restored when the failed VSAT is returned
to service.
Sun transit
Sun transit occurs when the conjunction of the satellite and the sun is
effective at the site of the earth station. Then the sun passes directly
in the line of sight path between the earth station antenna and the
satellite, hence the name ‘sun transit’.
Conjunction of the satellite and the sun has been introduced in
Chapter 2, section 2.3.6. This happens twice per year for several
minutes over a period of ﬁve or six days:
– before the spring equinox and after the autumn equinox for a
station in the northern hemisphere;
– after the spring equinox and before the autumn equinox for a
station in the southern hemisphere.
The sun radiation enters the earth station receiving antenna and
increases its noise temperature. This results in a reduced C/N0 . The

reduction can be calculated using the equations given in Chapter 5,
section 5.3.4.
Table 3.2 gives typical values of peak antenna noise temperatures
at sun transit for various antenna sizes at Ku-band. When no sun
transit effect is present the typical antenna noise temperature at
Ku-band is in the range 40 to 60 K (see Chapter 5, section 5.3).
The ability of the link to operate through peak sun transit times
depends on the built-in link margin. The margin usually implemented for reducing the down time due to rain effects to the typical
desired level of link availability of 99.9% is usually large enough to
protect the link from sun transit effects. Therefore, the sun transit
has little impact on the link availability.
At C-band, the sun transit effect is less pronounced than at
Ku-band.

3.2.11

Maintenance

The maintenance concerns the equipment on the ground: the hub
station and the VSATs. The customer may wish to be responsible
for all of the maintenance, or have the vendor handle some or all of
the work.
Maintenance at a shared hub is normally the responsibility of the
hub service provider. For a dedicated hub, the network operator
may wish to contract out or to perform the maintenance on his own.
In terms of maintenance staff, two different categories are required:
radio frequency and data communications.
A VSAT station should require as little maintenance as possible
as the operational cost of maintenance over a large number of sites
scattered over a large service zone would hamper the operational
cost of the network. Therefore, it is highly desirable that the maintenance of the VSAT be performed by local people in charge of other
duties. For instance, the local technician who maintains the existing
PC network on the site can also perform the normal maintenance
of the VSAT station. Self diagnostics and box level repair make his

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS

97

task much simpler. In the case of extensive trouble shooting, he can
call the equipment vendor for ad hoc assistance.
The network provider should warrant the availability of the
provided hardware and software for a given period, typically two
years. He should present a plan as to how all hardware and software
will be supported for a minimum of ten years.

3.2.12

Hazards

VSATs are usually located in urban areas or near areas where
people and animals may be around. They are usually unattended.
Problems are:

3.2.12.1 Protection of people and animals from radiation
The electromagnetic radiation should be kept to a harmless low
level: typically not more than 10 mWcm−2 per 6 hours. ETSI’s ETS
300 159 speciﬁes that a warning notice should be posted indicating
regions where the radiation may exceed 10 Wm−2 (= 1 mWcm−2 ).

3.2.12.2 Protection of hardware against
ill-intentioned people
Fences are a solution (see Figure 3.3), but it is safer if the outdoor
equipment is not easily accessible, although this renders maintenance more difﬁcult.

3.2.13

Cost

The cost of a VSAT per month per site has been shown to be
dependent on the number of VSATs in the network (see Chapter 1,
section 1.8), and the cost of the space segment is a sensitive issue.
Unfortunately, in most regions of the world the network operator
has little freedom of selecting the satellite operator to contract with.
The requested availability also has a strong impact on the network
cost, therefore the user should not ask for tight speciﬁcations unless
strictly needed.
One advantage often advocated by VSAT network operators is
the control of communications cost. To the initial investment cost is
added the maintenance costs, these can both be under the control of
the network operator.

98

OPERATIONAL ASPECTS

Therefore, cost containment is a fact. As mentioned above, a company most often turns to VSAT technology in replacement of existing
leased lines. As the cost of a link in a VSAT network is not distance
sensitive, both immediate and long term cost savings compared
to terrestrial alternatives will result if the company encompasses a
large number of dispersed sites to be connected.

4
Networking aspects
4.1

NETWORK FUNCTIONS

As mentioned in Chapter 1, VSAT networks usually offer a communications service between user terminals. These terminals generate
baseband signals that are analogue or digital, predominantly digital.
For signals generated by a source terminal and to be delivered to a
destination terminal, the VSAT network must provide the following
functions:
– establish a connection between the calling terminal and the
called one;
– route the signals from the calling terminal to the called one,
although the physical resource offered for the considered connection may be shared by other signals on other connections;
– deliver the information in a reliable manner.
Reliable delivery of data means that data is accepted at one end of
a connection in the same order as it was transmitted at the other end,
without loss and without duplication. This implies four constraints:
– no loss (at least one copy of each part of the information content
is delivered);
– no duplication (no more than one copy is delivered);
– ﬁrst in ﬁrst out (FIFO) delivery (the different parts of the information content are delivered in the original order);
– the information content is delivered within a reasonable time
delay.

NETWORKING ASPECTS

It has been indicated in Chapter 1 section 1.4 that VSAT networks
could be envisaged to support many different types of trafﬁc. However, the network cannot convey all such different types of trafﬁc in
a cost effective way. Therefore, VSAT networks are optimised for a
given set of trafﬁc types, which reﬂect the dominant service demand
from the user, and may offer as an option other types of service, but
not as efﬁciently. Most VSAT networks are optimised for interactive
exchange of data.
This chapter aims to present the characteristics of trafﬁc the
network may have to convey for interactive data services, and the
relevant techniques used for conveying such trafﬁc.

4.2
4.2.1

SOME DEFINITIONS
Links and connections

A link serves as a physical support in a network for a connection
between a sending terminal and a receiving one. The network
consists of several links and nodes. Every link has two end nodes:
one that sends and one that receives.
In a VSAT network, one ﬁnds:
– radio frequency links (uplinks and downlinks);
– cable links between the outdoor and the indoor units, or between
the indoor unit and the user terminal;
– possibly terrestrial lines (microwaves or leased terrestrial lines,
or lines as part of a public switching network) between the hub
and the customer’s central facility.
Some connections are one-way, thus requiring that information only travels in one direction: for such connections simplex
links can be used. An example of a simplex link is a radio frequency wave.
Other connections require interactivity, and hence two-way ﬂow
of information. It may be that the information ﬂow is not simultaneous in both ways, but alternate. The supporting links for such
connections are named half duplex links. An example is when a given
radio frequency bandwidth is used alternately by two receiving and
transmitting units on a ‘push-to-talk’ mode: one unit transmits on
the bandwidth for some time, while the other unit operates in the
receive mode. Once this is done, the transmitter turns to the receive
mode, and the receiver to the transmit mode, and information ﬂows
the other way round.

NETWORKING ASPECTS

101

When the information must travel both ways simultaneously the
supporting links are called full duplex links. An example is the line
from a telephone handset to the indoor unit (IDU).
Radio frequency links of VSAT networks are inherently simplex
links, but a connection requiring full duplex links can be implemented using two radio frequency links: one for each direction of
information ﬂow. In a star-shaped network, a duplex link between a
given VSAT and the hub is constituted for one part by the inbound
link and for the other by the outbound link.
A link can support one connection at a time, in a so-called
Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC) mode, or be shared by several
connections, in a so-called Multiple Channels Per Carrier (MCPC)
mode. Figure 4.1 illustrates these concepts.

4.2.2

Bit rate

Basically, the bit rate is the number of bits transferred per time unit
(second) on a given link. A distinction should be made between:
– the information bit rate Rb , which is the rate at which information
bits conveying data messages of interest to the end users are
delivered on the link by the data source;
– the channel bit rate Rc , which corresponds to the actual bit
rate on a given link while the connection is active. Along with
information bits, other bits for error correction and signalling
purposes may also be transmitted, so that the channel bit rate on
the link is higher than the information bit rate. The channel bit
rate imposes bandwidth requirements on the physical support,
depending on the format used at baseband to represent a bit or
a group of bits, also called symbol, and, at radio frequency, on
the type of coded modulation used;
– the average bit rate R: links may not be active at all times
as connections may be used intermittently, and actually are
frequently inactive in case of bursty trafﬁc, made of short data
bursts at random intervals. Therefore the average transmitted
bit rate is lower than the observed bit rate at times when the link
is active. Averaging may apply to either the information bit rate
or to the channel bit rate.
Consider, for instance, a user terminal acting as a signal source
and delivering messages at an average rate of one message per
second to a VSAT for transfer to the hub station over a satellite
link (Figure 4.1(a)). Every message contains 1000 information bits.

The baseband interface of the indoor unit (IDU) of the VSAT adds
some overhead H = 48 bits to the message and sends a data unit
consisting of the data ﬁeld D = 1000 bits preceded by the overhead
H = 48 bits to the FEC encoder at a rate Rb = 64 kbs−1 . Therefore
the data unit has a duration of 1048/64 000 seconds, which is equal
to 16.375 ms. The FEC encoder adds one redundant bit to every

NETWORKING ASPECTS

103

received bit which means a code rate ρ = 1/2. The data unit now
modulating the carrier consists of (D + H)/ρ = 2 × 1048 = 2096 bits,
and those bits are still occupying a time interval of 16.375 ms
corresponding to the duration of the data unit. Thus, the channel bit
rate is Rc = ((D + H)/ρ) × (1/16.375 ms) = 128 kbs−1 . The average
time interval between two messages being 1 second, the average
information bit rate Rb  is:
Rb  = 1000 bits/1 s = 1 kbs−1
The link being active at rate Rc = 128 kbs−1 only 16.375 ms out of
every second, the average channel bit rate Rc  is:
Rc  = Rc × (16.375 ms/1 s) = 2.096 kbs−1

4.2.3

Protocols

A protocol is a procedure for establishing and controlling the interchange of information over a network.
For non-data type trafﬁc, the protocols are usually simple and
reduce to connection set-up between two end points of a link
(TV, voice).
Data communications between the different parts of a network, or
between different networks, entail a layered functional architecture
which describes how data communications processes are handled.
A data protocol is a set of rules for establishing and controlling
the exchange of information between peer layers of the network
functional architecture.
An example of such a layered architecture is that of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) developed by the International Standards
Organisation (ISO). This reference model is illustrated in Figure 4.3
and will be discussed in more detail in section 4.5.

4.2.4

Delay

Transfer of information from one user connected to a network to
another entails some delay. As mentioned in Chapter 3, section 3.2.8,
delay originates from queueing time, transmission time, propagation time, processing time, and protocol induced delay.
Delay conditions the network response time perceived by the user
from the instant he requests a service to the instant the service
is performed. The network response time is highly dependent on
the type of service considered. For instance:

104

NETWORKING ASPECTS

– for a data transfer service, the response time would be measured
as the time elapsed from the instant the ﬁrst bit of the transmitted
data message leaves the sender terminal to the instant the last
bit of the message is received at the destination terminal;
– for an interactive data or an enquiry/response service, the
response time of a VSAT network would be measured as the
time elapsed between when the ‘enter’ key is pressed at the
remote terminal and the ﬁrst character of the response appears
on the screen.
Delay is one aspect but delay jitter is also of importance for
some applications, such as voice or video transmission. Delay jitter
represents the amplitude variation of delay value about its average
value, and can be characterised for instance by the value of delay
standard deviation.

4.2.5

Throughput

The throughput THRU is the average rate at which a connection in
the network delivers information bits to the receiver.
THRU = Rb 

(bs−1 )

(4.1)

The throughput cannot exceed the rate Rb at which the source sends
information bits into the network. It may even be lower than this
rate because of overheads, message loss, or source blocking time
due to ﬂow control. It is bounded by the maximum throughput,
which is a function of the network load. As the source increases its
input rate, the actual throughput will grow up to a limit and then
remain constant or even deteriorate [FER90].

4.2.6

Channel efficiency

The channel efﬁciency measures the efﬁciency of the connection by
comparing its throughput to the rate Rb at which the source sends
information bits:
Rb 

Channel utilisation

The channel utilisation is the ratio of the time the connection is used
to the sum of the idle time plus the time the connection is used.

TRAFFIC CHARACTERISATION

Trafﬁc characterisation entails different aspects depending on the
involved parties and the considered time in the evolution of a
network.

4.3.1

Traffic forecasts

This means estimating the type and volume of trafﬁc at peak
hours that will be conveyed by the network. Such forecasts should
include: trafﬁc breakdown among the different services, variability
of the trafﬁc volume and breakdown from site to site, degree
of asymmetry of bidirectional services. This information represents
valuable input to the network provider for his network design, prior
to any operation, and for the dimensioning of links and interface
equipment. Unfortunately, the user is most often incapable of stating
a precise activity plan, so it is difﬁcult to make any accurate trafﬁc
forecasts. It is less of a problem if measurements can be done on an
existing terrestrial network to be replaced by the VSAT network.

4.3.2

Traffic measurements

Measuring the trafﬁc deals with collecting actual values of the trafﬁc
ﬂows in order to provide representative values of the parameters
included in the trafﬁc models. This implies a clear perception of
which parameters are to be measured, and when and where they are
to be measured. Measurements are available only once the network
is operational or, prior to its installation, on the existing network it is
supposed to replace. There is some risk in basing the dimensioning of
a VSAT network on trafﬁc measurements performed on an existing
network to be replaced by the VSAT network, as the client’s staff
may change working and communicating habits once the VSAT
network is in operation. Therefore, as mentioned in Chapter 3,
section 3.2.4, it is prudent to proceed with such measurements
during the installation tests prior to the full deployment of the
VSAT network, and to make provision for spare capacity, in case of
a higher trafﬁc demand than anticipated. Experience shows that the
statistical information provided by a network management system
(NMS), indicating for example the number of calls and the volume
of messages sent into the network by the user’s terminal, may be
adequate for network monitoring and billing procedures but is not
accurate enough for a proper dimensioning of the network. Indeed, it

106

NETWORKING ASPECTS

does not take into account the actual volume of messages generated
in the network as a result of information transfer according to endto-end or local protocols. Such protocols are responsible for error
recovery and ﬂow control, and inﬂuence the actual trafﬁc volume in
the network and the network throughput.

4.3.3

Traffic source modelling

This involves developing adequate synthetic inputs to the network
designer, sufﬁciently simple to allow mathematical treatment, or to
limit the load of the simulation tool, and still sufﬁciently complex
to represent the trafﬁc generated by a source in a realistic manner.
Trafﬁc source models should, as far as possible, include parameters
that can be interpreted physically. Examples of popular trafﬁc source
models are given in Appendix 1.
Trafﬁc sources can be characterised statistically at call level and
burst level.
A call is the means by which a terminal connected to a VSAT in
the network indicates its intention to send messages to some other
terminal. Some networks offer permanent connections between terminals in the form of leased terrestrial lines. In such circumstances,
initiating a call is useless, as a physical path is always available along
which the sender can send messages to the destination terminal.
VSAT networks may also offer permanent connections between
any two terminals: for this, some bandwidth must be reserved for
any carrier between the two VSATs to which the terminals are
connected (meshed network) or between the two VSATs and the
hub (star network). Most often, this solution is not cost effective,
and the required bandwidth will be allocated for the time interval
when messages are to be exchanged. Thus, demand assignment is a
built-in feature of most VSAT networks. Therefore, before sending
messages, a terminal must initiate a call which will be processed by
the VSAT network management system (NMS).
Once a connection is established, as a result of call generation
and acceptance, the sending terminal is able to transfer messages.
Should the message transfer correspond to a continuous ﬂow of data
during the call, then the trafﬁc on the connection is of ‘stream’ type.
The characterisation of the trafﬁc during the call (arrival time and
duration) has the same parameters as that of the call. Should now
the message transfer occur by sequences of small packets, also called
bursts, then the trafﬁc is said to be ‘bursty’, with characteristics of
its own.
Figure 4.2 illustrates the two above situations.

4.3.3.1 Call characterisation
Parameters are:
– call generation rate: λc (s−1 )
– mean duration of call: T (s)
When a call is generated, a network resource has to be allocated by
the network management system (NMS), in the form of a connection
over links with the required capacity. The probability of calls being
blocked as a result of lack of network capacity can be estimated from
the Erlang formula, which assumes that blocked calls are cleared
(the NMS does not keep memory of blocked calls). The formula
gives the probability that n connections out of C are occupied:

4.3.3.2 Stream traffic
Stream trafﬁc refers to the situation where a continuous transfer of
information occurs once the connection between two terminals has
been set up for the purpose of that transfer. Therefore, stream trafﬁc
can be characterised by the call connection set-up rate λc , as this
parameter indicates how frequently the trafﬁc is generated by the
transmitting terminal. Once the connection is set up, the information
transfer is constant and performed at peak bit rate.
An example of such trafﬁc is transfer of video or audio signals.
Telephony signals can be considered as stream trafﬁc, although
the interactivity between users implies a duplex connection, and
transfer of information usually is not continuous on each of the two
connections, as normally one end user would remain silent while
the other talks. Therefore, telephony signals, although classiﬁed
in the stream trafﬁc category, entail some of the characteristics of
bursty trafﬁc.

4.3.3.3 Bursty traffic
Bursty trafﬁc refers to intermittent transfer of information during
a connection, in the form of individual messages. Messages are
short data bursts at random intervals. Typically, this situation arises
when a human operated PC is activated by its operator after some
thinking time (activation being performed, for instance, by pressing
the ‘enter’ key on the key pad), thus generating the transfer of some
data to another terminal. It also results from the speciﬁc protocols
that are used for data transfer, with information being segmented
by the transmitting terminal and segments being acknowledged in
the form of short messages by the receiving terminal prior to further
transmission by the transmitting terminal.
Bursts introduce new temporal features, characterised as follows:
– the burst generation rate: λ (s−1 )
– the average length of a burst: L (bits)
The interarrival time (IAT) is the time between two successive
generations of burst (see Appendix 1). The average interarrival time
 IAT is equal to:
1
(s)
(4.8)
IAT =
λ
It is convenient to introduce a measure of how bursty the trafﬁc
is. A practical deﬁnition for burstiness, BU, is the ratio of the peak

THE OSI REFERENCE MODEL FOR DATA
COMMUNICATIONS

The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model was originally formulated to provide a basis for deﬁning standards for
the interconnection of computer systems. Such standards became
a necessity when it was found that different hardware and software installed in different branches of the same organisation were

NETWORKING ASPECTS

111

incapable of exchanging information as a result of incompatibilities. In an attempt to overcome these incompatibilities and create
a basis for vendor-independent capabilities of information systems,
the International Standards Organization (ISO) has created a model
which deﬁnes seven functional layers for protocols, as indicated in
Figure 4.4.
The ﬁgure displays two stacks of layers, one for each of the two
interconnected systems. The system on the left is the source machine,
generating data to be transmitted in a reliable manner to the system
on the right, which is the destination machine. Within one machine,
a layer presents an interface consisting of one or more service access
points and provides services to the next higher layer while utilising
the services provided by the next lower layer. Layers in different
stacks at the same level are called ‘peer’ layers. At every layer,
there is a pair of cooperating processes, one in each machine, which
exchange messages according to the corresponding layer protocol.

NETWORKING ASPECTS

The message generated at a given layer is actually passed down to
the next lower layer, which is physically implemented by hardware
and software on the same machine. In this way, the actual data
transmission path is down each stack, along the physical medium
below the physical layer which connects the two systems, and up
the stacks again.
Messages between layers are called protocol data units (PDUs).
A PDU consists of data preceded by a header (H) and possibly
followed by a trailer (T). When a given layer wants to transmit a
PDU to its peer layer on the other system, it passes down that PDU
to the next lower layer along with some parameters related to the
service being requested. Every lower layer accepts the higher layer’s
PDU as its data, uses the parameters to determine what should be
included in the header and appends its own header, and possibly
a trailer, so that its peer layer on the other system will know what
to do with the data. This procedure is called ‘encapsulation’, and is
illustrated in Figure 4.5.
When a message is received in a machine, it passes through the
layers. Every layer deciphers its header to derive information on
how to handle the data and then strips the header before passing
the data up to the next higher layer.
The lower three layers are responsible for the transmission and
communications aspects, whereas the upper four layers take care
of the end-to-end communication and information exchange. A
computer system (hardware and software) which conforms to these
rules and standards is termed an ‘open system’. These systems can
be interconnected into an ‘open systems environment’ with full
interoperability.

4.4.1

The physical layer

The physical layer deals with actual transfer of information on
the physical medium which constitutes a link, as described in
section 4.2.1. Hence, it is concerned with all aspects of bit transmission: bit format, bit rate, bit error rate, forward error correction
(FEC) encoding and decoding, modulation and demodulation, etc.

4.4.2

The data link layer

The data link layer ensures the reliable delivery of data across the
physical link. It sends blocks of data called ‘frames’ and provides
the necessary frame identiﬁcation, error control, and ﬂow control.

4.4.2.1 Detection of damaged, lost or duplicated frames
and error recovery
The sender organises data in frames of typically a few hundred
bytes and transmits the frames sequentially. Frames are identiﬁed
by means of special bit patterns at the beginning and the end of every
frame. Precautions are taken to avoid these bit patterns occurring in
the data ﬁeld.
Upon reception of frames, the receiver sends acknowledgement
frames. However, as noise on the link may introduce bit errors, the
receiving device must be able to detect such an occurrence. This is
performed thanks to checksum bits in the trailer of the frame.
Should the checksum be incorrect, the receiving device sends
no acknowledgement frame to the sending device. Not receiving
an acknowledgement frame within a given time limit, the sending

114

NETWORKING ASPECTS

device retransmits the frame. Hopefully this frame will be correctly received. Otherwise, no acknowledgement is delivered and
retransmissions will occur until completion of error-free reception.
Multiple transmissions of a frame introduce the possibility of
duplicate frames: this would happen, for instance, if the routeing
delay exceeded the time limit for retransmission. One or several
duplicate frames may be generated before the receiving device
has had a chance to transmit its acknowledgement. To obviate
this problem, a sequence number in the frame header indicates to
the receiver if the received frame is a new frame or a duplicate.
Duplicated frames can therefore be discarded.

4.4.2.2 Flow control
A fast sender must be kept from saturating a slow receiver in data.
Some trafﬁc regulation must be employed to inform at any instant
the sender how much buffer space the receiver has available. This
is done by means of sliding window techniques [TAN89, p224]: at
any instant, the sender maintains a list of consecutive sequence
numbers corresponding to frames it is permitted to send. These
frames are said to fall within the sending window. Similarly, the
receiver also maintains a receiving window corresponding to frames
it is permitted to accept.

4.4.3

The network layer

The network layer is responsible for routeing packets from the
source to the destination. Therefore, it is concerned by transfer of
data over multiple links in the network. This implies identifying
the destination (addressing function), identifying the path (routeing), and making sure that the resource is available (congestion
control). It also has to identify the link user for purposes of billing
(accounting function).

4.4.3.1 Addressing
The network layer is in charge of identifying the destination of data.
The receiving device is known by its address. However, this address
may be different from one network to the other. For instance, the
end terminal may be part of a local area network (LAN) connected
to a VSAT. The address of that speciﬁc terminal in the LAN may
be different from the address of that same terminal in the VSAT

NETWORKING ASPECTS

115

network. Therefore, it is up to the network layer to perform the
proper address mapping.

4.4.3.2 Routeing of information
The network layer is in charge of determining which links are
used. The utilisation of links can be on a ﬁxed assignment basis or
on demand.

4.4.3.3 Congestion control
The network layer is also in charge of determining how links are
used. For instance it is up to the network layer to regulate the trafﬁc
ﬂow in order to avoid congestion on the link, should the trafﬁc ﬂow
exceed the capacity of the link.

4.4.3.4 Accounting
The network layer supervises the amount of information delivered at
any network input and output so as to produce billing information.

4.4.4

The transport layer

The transport layer is in charge of providing reliable data transport from the source machine to the destination machine. Hence,
it is an end-to-end layer: it deals with functionalities required
between end terminals, possibly communicating through several
different networks.

4.4.4.1 End-to-end transfer of data
The transport layer accepts data from the session layer, splits it
into smaller units if needed, passes these to the network layer and
ensures that all pieces arrive correctly at the other end.

4.4.4.2 Multiplexing
The transport layer may organise the routeing of several transport connections onto a unique network connection. This is called
multiplexing and should be transparent to the session layer.

116

NETWORKING ASPECTS

4.4.4.3 Flow control
The transport layer is in charge of controlling the ﬂow of information
between the end terminals so that a fast terminal does not saturate
a slow one. This ﬂow control is distinct from that of the data link
layer, although it can be done by similar means.

4.4.5

The upper layers (5 to 7)

These are: the session layer, the presentation layer, and the application layer. All are end-to-end layers. These layers are of no concern
to VSAT networks. Hence they will not be discussed here. For
further information the reader may refer to books on computer
communications.

APPLICATION TO VSAT NETWORKS
Physical and protocol configurations
of a VSAT network

A VSAT network essentially provides a connection between any
remote user terminal and the host computer. Figure 4.6 illustrates
two representations of the end terminals (host computer and user
terminals) and the VSAT network in between. One is a physical
conﬁguration which indicates the kind of equipment that support
the connection, the other is the protocol conﬁguration which
displays the peer layers between the above equipment. The physical
conﬁguration shown here displays the hub baseband interface which
is part of the indoor unit of the hub, as shown in Figure 1.26, to which
the host computer is connected, and the VSAT baseband interface
which is part of the VSAT indoor unit, as shown in Figure 1.20, to
which the user terminals are connected. The protocol conﬁguration
displays the respective stacks of layers from one to seven within the
host computer and the user terminal and reduced stacks for the front
end processor and the baseband interface of the VSAT indoor unit.
Such a conﬁguration allows for protocol conversion, also named
emulation, which will now be presented.

4.5.2

Protocol conversion (emulation)

For the protocol conﬁguration of Figure 4.6, it would be convenient
to have a similar one to that of Figure 4.4, where peer-to-peer interactions between end terminals are end-to-end. The VSAT network

would act as a pure ‘cable in the sky’ at the physical layer level,
and interconnection of the customer’s machines (user terminals and
host computer) would be most easy to perform. However, this is not
feasible as a result of the characteristics of the satellite channel where
information is conveyed at radio frequency with propagation delay
and bit error rate. These characteristics differ from those of the terrestrial links for which the protocols used on the customer’s machines
have been designed. Terrestrial links usually display shorter delays
and lower bit error rates than those encountered on satellite links.
Consequently, terrestrial oriented protocols may become inefﬁcient
over satellite links. Therefore, different protocols must be considered

118

NETWORKING ASPECTS

for data transfer over satellite links. Such protocols, however, cannot
be end-to-end protocols, as this would imply changing the protocols
implemented on the customer’s machine, which would be unacceptable to the customer. So, ﬁnally, the solution is to implement some
form of protocol conversion both at the hub baseband interface and
the VSAT baseband interface. The conversion of end terminal protocols into satellite link protocols is called emulation, or in a more colloquial manner, spooﬁng. Indeed, if the conversion is adequate, that is
if it ensures end-to-end transparency, the end terminals will have the
impression of being directly interconnected, although they are not.
In Figure 4.6, only the three lower layers (network, data, and
physical) are emulated. This corresponds to a common situation.
However, some services might require that emulation be carried up
to the transport layer.
The network layer protocol emulation performs address mapping
for the customer’s machines. This enables the network addresses to
be independent of the customer addresses.
The data link layer is split into two sublayers: the sublayer named
‘data link control’ provides data link control over the satellite links
independently from the data link control between the VSAT network interfaces and the customer’s machines. The sublayer called
‘satellite channel access control’ is responsible for the access to the
satellite channel by multiple carriers transmitted by the VSATs or
the hub station. An important aspect here, which is speciﬁc to VSAT
networks, is that the powered bandwidth of the satellite required
for the carrier which provides the connection at the physical level,
if allocated on a permanent basis, is poorly used in the case of infrequent stream trafﬁc or with bursty trafﬁc. It is, therefore, desirable
that this satellite resource be allocated to any VSAT earth station
on a demand assignment (DA) basis, as presented in Chapter 1,
section 1.6.3, according to the trafﬁc demand and characteristics.
Finally, at the physical level, any earth station (hub or VSAT) has
to provide a physical interface which actually supports the physical
connection. On the customer’s side, the physical interface should
be compliant with the customer’s hardware. On the satellite side,
the physical level should provide protection of data against errors
by means of forward error correction (FEC) encoding and decoding techniques, and modulate or demodulate carriers conveying
the data.

4.5.3

Reasons for protocol conversion

This section aims to discuss in more detail some of the underlying
reasons exposed above.

NETWORKING ASPECTS

119

Satellite links differ from terrestrial links in two ways:
1. The large propagation delay, about 270 ms, from one site to
another over satellite links in comparison to the much smaller
delays encountered on terrestrial networks, typically a few milliseconds to tens of milliseconds.
2. The bit error rate: satellite links are corrupted by noise which
affects the carrier demodulation process. The bit error rate can be
reduced to levels typically of 10−7 thanks to the use of forward
error correction (FEC) but this is still higher than the bit error rate
level encountered on terrestrial links.
It will now be shown how these characteristics impact on protocols
when used over satellite links.

4.5.3.1 Impact on error control
The following example deals with transmission of a data stream
over a connection from the host computer to a user terminal,
using automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocols for error control.
The data link layer gets its protocol data unit (packet) from the
network layer and encapsulates it in a frame by adding its data
link header and trailer to it (see Figure 4.5). This frame is then
transmitted over the network to the data link layer of the user
terminal which veriﬁes the integrity of data by means of the error
detection information contained in the trailer of the frame. Should
the received data be error free, the user terminal sends a positive
acknowledgement (ACK) back to the host computer. If not, it sends
a negative acknowledgement (NACK). If it receives no ACK and no
NACK after a time out delay, then it retransmits the frame.
In the following, three ARQ protocols are considered (Figure 4.7):
– a stop-and-wait (SW) protocol: the host computer waits until it
receives a positive acknowledgement, ACK, before sending the
next frame. If a negative acknowledgement, NACK, is received,
the host computer retransmits the same frame (Figure 4.7(a));
– a go-back-N protocol (GBN): the host computer transmits frames
in sequence as long as it does not receive any negative acknowledgement, NACK. Receiving NACK for frame N, it retransmits
frame N and all subsequent frames (Figure 4.7(b));
– a selective-repeat (SR) protocol: the host computer transmits
frames in sequence as long as it does not receive a negative
acknowledgement, NACK. Receiving a NACK for frame N while

sending frame N + n, it retransmits frame N after frame N + n,
then continues with frame N + n + 1 and the subsequent ones
(Figure 4.7(c), here n = 2).
The three protocols will now be compared on the basis of the channel efﬁciency. Appendix 2 demonstrates that the channel efﬁciency
ηc for every protocol is equal to:
stop-and-wait:
go-back-N:
selective-repeat:

where:
D = number of information bits per frame (bits)
L = length of frame (bits) = D + H (information plus overhead)
Pf = frame error probability = 1 − (1 − BER)L , where BER is the
bit error rate

NETWORKING ASPECTS

121

Rb = information bit rate over the connection (bs−1 )
TRT = round trip time (s)
The round trip time TRT corresponds to the addition of service
times and propagation delays. At time L/Rb , the last bit of the frame
has been sent. At time L/Rb plus the propagation delay Tp from the
sender to the receiver, the last bit has arrived at the receiver. From
a host computer to a user terminal over a terrestrial link, Tp is about
5 ms. From a VSAT to the hub station over a satellite link, Tp is about
260 ms (see Figure 2.22). Neglecting the processing time, the receiver
is now ready to send the acknowledgement message. Denote by A
the acknowledgement frame length and Rback the information bit
rate at which the acknowledgement is sent on the return link. At time
L/Rb + Tp + A/Rback , the last bit of the acknowledgement frame has
been sent. At time L/Rb + Tp + A/Rback + Tp the sender has received
the acknowledgement. So the round trip time is:
TRT =

L
A
+ 2Tp +
Rb
Rback

(s)

(4.13)

One can neglect A/Rback relative to L/Rb as the acknowledgement
frame length is much smaller than the frame length L (it often
reduces to the header H), and for a star VSAT network generally
Rback is the outbound link bit rate which is usually larger than Rb .
Therefore the round trip time can be approximated by:
TRT =

L
+ 2Tp
Rb

(s)

(4.14)

Figure 4.8 compares channel efﬁciency ηcSW and ηcGBN as a function of the round trip time TRT for different values of the bit error
rate. The parameter values selected here are:
D = 1000 bits
H = 48 bits
L = 1048 bits
Rb = 64 kb/s
On a terrestrial link, taking Tp = 5 ms, TRT would be about 26 ms.
On a satellite link, taking Tp = 260 ms, TRT would be about 536 ms.
With the selective-repeat protocol, the channel efﬁciency is independent of the round trip time. It can be seen that ηcSR is always
greater than with the two other protocols. With the selected parameter values, one obtains the values indicated in Table 4.2.
Figure 4.8 indicates that the channel loses much of its efﬁciency
when a stop-and-wait protocol is implemented on a satellite link, as

a result of the increased round trip time compared to terrestrial links.
The same is true of a go-back-N protocol should the satellite link be
of poor quality (bit error rate in the range 10−4 to 10−5 ). If the satellite
link has a bit error rate in the order of 10−7 , then no degradation
is observed. Finally, as seen from Table 4.2, the selective-repeat
protocol, which offers a good performance for reasonably low bit
error rates, is a good candidate for satellite links as it is not sensitive
to a long round trip delay.

4.5.3.2 Impact on flow control
Protocols at the data link layer and transport layer levels often make
use of sliding windows for ﬂow control purposes. In such cases,
only positive acknowledgements (ACK) are sent. Not receiving
an acknowledgement before a given time-out interval, the sender
retransmits the protocol data unit which has not been acknowledged.
The sender can only send a limited number of protocol data units
following the last acknowledged one. These are said to fall within

NETWORKING ASPECTS

123

the sending window. The window slides by one position at every
received acknowledgement, therefore initiating the clearance for
sending a subsequent protocol data unit. Similarly, the receiver
accepts only a limited number of protocol data units before sending
a positive acknowledgement. Any incoming protocol data unit that
falls outside the window is discarded. The window slides by one
position at every emitted acknowledgement, and the receiver can
subsequently accept one more protocol data unit.
It can be shown that the channel efﬁciency for a sliding window
protocol with error control based on the selective-repeat procedure
is [TAN89, p 243]:

Figure 4.9 represents the channel efﬁciency as a function of the
round trip time TRT for the example discussed in the previous
section. Different window sizes are considered, from 1 to 31. The
case W = 1 corresponds to a stop-and-wait protocol, as presented
in the previous section. One can see from the ﬁgure and from

equation (4.16) that satellite links require large window values to be
efﬁcient, while for terrestrial links, small values can be implemented.
This can be explained as follows: the quantity Rb TRT /2L represents
the number of protocol data units that the link from the sender to
the receiver can hold. The quantity Rb TRT /L, conditions the selection
of either equation (4.15) or (4.16) to express the channel efﬁciency.
The horizontal parts of the curves in Figure 4.9 are obtained from
equation (4.16), while the sharp decreases are expressed by (4.15).
The quantity Rb TRT /L represents the total number of protocol data
units ﬁlling both the direct and return links from sender to receiver.
Should the window exceed that quantity, then transmission goes
on continuously and the protocol leads to an efﬁcient use of the
channel (horizontal part of the curve). If the window is less than
that quantity, the sender is blocked when the window is full and
has to wait for an acknowledgement to come in before resuming
transmission. As the channel is not being used during this waiting
time (the longer the round trip time, the longer the waiting time), the
use of the channel is reduced and the channel efﬁciency decreases.
One can conclude by stating that ﬂow control over satellite links
using sliding window protocols is feasible without loss of channel
efﬁciency if the window is large enough.

4.5.3.3 Polling over satellite links
Figure 4.10 illustrates a typical synchronous data link control (SDLC)
environment, where the host computer communicates with a series
of remote user terminals by means of a multidrop line. The host
computer manages the transfer of data between itself and the user
terminals, on the shared capacity of the multidrop line by means of
a technique named polling.
Polling means that the host sends a message to every user terminal
it controls, inquiring whether or not the user terminal has anything
to send. Every user terminal acknowledges its own poll and sends
along data if it has data to send. The host then acknowledges
reception of data. If the user terminal has no data to send, it sends
a ‘poll reject’ message and the host polls the next user terminal in a
round-robin fashion.
Alternatively, the host when having data to send to a given user
terminal sends this data along with its poll. The user terminal sends
an acknowledgement to the host for the accepted data, possibly
along with its own data.
A network would possibly comprise a host and several multidrop
lines such as the one illustrated in Figure 4.10, using permanent
terrestrial leased lines or temporary connections via the public

switched network. It is assumed that the company which utilises
the private network wishes to replace part or all of it by a VSAT
network, as shown in Figure 4.11.
It is undesirable to pass every polling message and its acknowledgement across the satellite. Such a scheme would produce high
transmission delays, as every handshake would take 0.5 s, and waste
transponder capacity, as every poll is not necessarily followed by
transfer of data.
To put this into perspective, consider a terrestrial network incorporating one host, n = 10 user terminals and a multidrop line.
Assuming:
– maximum transmission delay over the multidrop line: td = 5 ms;
– maximum message processing time (poll and/or acknowledgement plus data if any): tm = 1 ms
Each polling involves transmitting the message from the host to the
user terminal (td = 5 ms), processing the message at the user terminal (tm = 1 ms) and transmitting the reply from the user terminal to
the host (td = 5 ms). The polling time of a user terminal then is:
tp = td + tm + td = 11 ms
The maximum network response time is the cycle time (n user
terminals in the cycle):
tr = ntp = 110 ms
The mean network response time, assuming constant probability
density for all delays, is one half the maximum delay which amounts
to 55 ms.

Now consider that the multidrop line is replaced by satellite links.
Then tp = 250 ms, and the cycle time becomes:
tr = n(td + tm + td ) = 10(250 + 1 + 250) = 5

seconds

So the maximum network response time increases from 110 ms
to 5 s with mean value increasing from 55 ms to 2.5 s. Notice that
in the absence of trafﬁc, the satellite links still convey polls and
acknowledgements, thus using bandwidth for no data transfer.

NETWORKING ASPECTS

127

To avoid these undesirable effects, polling emulation may be
implemented at the remote sites and at the central facility, as
illustrated in Figure 4.11: at the remote site, the VSAT interface polls
the user terminals, thus acting as the host computer in Figure 4.10,
while at the central facility, the ports of the hub interface, as many
as the remote sites, are polled by the host, acting as ‘virtual’ user
terminals.
Acknowledgements are provided by the hub interface ports as
soon as they receive the polling message from the host, and the
VSAT interface independently polls every user terminal. Data messages are transmitted on the satellite links only if a user terminal
responds to polling by transmitting data, or if the host selects
one of the hub interface ports to transmit data. VSAT and hub
interfaces must provide buffering and ﬂow control on the satellite
links. This avoids satellite bandwidth being used in the absence
of trafﬁc.
One can evaluate the network response time with polling emulation over satellite links. It amounts to a maximum of one cycle time
at the host/hub interface plus propagation time from host to VSAT,
plus a maximum of one cycle time at the VSAT/user terminal interface, plus propagation time from VSAT to hub, plus a maximum of
one cycle time at the hub/host interface, i.e.:
Tr = 10(5 + 1 + 5) + 250 + 10(5 + 1 + 5) + 250
+ 10(5 + 1 + 5) = 830 ms.
The increase in response time from terrestrial network to VSAT
network is now less than with direct polling over satellite links (from
110 ms to 830 ms maximum, instead of 5 seconds), in conjunction
with using satellite bandwidth only when needed.

4.5.3.4 Conclusion
The above examples show that protocols that perform adequately
on terrestrial links may work poorly when used as such on satellite
links. Hence, there is a need for protocol tuning or protocol conversion at the interface between end terminals and the VSAT network,
or between other networks and the VSAT network.

4.6

MULTIPLE ACCESS

The earth stations of a VSAT network communicate across the
satellite by means of modulated carriers. Depending on the network conﬁguration, different types and numbers of carriers must

128

NETWORKING ASPECTS

be routed simultaneously within the same satellite transponder.
Figure 4.12 illustrates different possible situations:
– with one-way networks, where the hub broadcasts a time division multiplex of data to many receive-only VSATs, only one
carrier is to be relayed by the satellite transponder. Accordingly,
there is no other carrier competing for satellite transponder
access, and there is no need for any multiple access protocol;
– with two-way star-shaped networks, carriers from VSATs and
the hub station are competing to access a satellite transponder;
– with two-way meshed networks, there is no hub station and
the only carriers competing to access a satellite transponder are
those transmitted by the VSAT stations.
Multiple access is therefore to be considered in the two latter
situations only. Multiple access schemes differ in the way the satellite

transponder resource, which is powered bandwidth during the
lifetime of the satellite, is shared among the contenders.

4.6.1

Basic multiple access protocols

Figure 4.13 illustrates the ways of partitioning the bandwidth of a
satellite transponder between multiple carriers with time [MAR02,
Chapter 6]:
– Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) means allocating a
given subband of overall transponder bandwidth, B, to every
carrier. The allocated subband, shown as b for a speciﬁc carrier
in Figure 4.13, must be compatible with the carrier bandwidth
which depends on the bit rate it conveys and the type of modulation and coding (see Chapter 5, section 5.8). The bit rate on
the carriers may correspond to the trafﬁc of one one-way connection: this is a Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC) mode, or
to several one-way connections which are time division multiplexed (TDM), and then this is a Multiple Channels Per Carrier
(MCPC) mode.
– Time division multiple access (TDMA) means allocating the overall
bandwidth of the transponder, B, to every carrier in sequence for
a limited amount of time, called a time slot.
The sequence may be random, every station transmitting a
data packet on a carrier burst with duration equal to a time
slot whenever it has data to transmit, without being coordinated

130

NETWORKING ASPECTS

with respect to other stations. This is named ‘random TDMA’
and is best represented by the so-called ALOHA type protocols.
As a result of the random nature of transmissions, such multiple
access schemes do not protect two or more carrier bursts transmitted by separate stations from possibly colliding within the
transponder (that is overlapping in time). The interference which
results then prevents the receiving stations from retrieving the
data packets from the corrupted bursts. To provide error-free
transmission, ALOHA protocols make use of ARQ strategies by
sending acknowledgements for every packet correctly received:
in case of collision, the transmitting stations not receiving any
acknowledgement before the end of their time-out interval, will
retransmit the unacknowledged packet at the end of a random
time interval calculated independently at every station, so as to
avoid another collision.
Alternatively, the sequence may be synchronised in such a
way that bursts occupy assigned non-overlapping time slots.
This implies that the time slots are organised within a periodic
structure, called a TDMA frame, with as many time slots as
active stations (note that the term ‘frame’, with TDMA, should
not be confused with the term used in computer communications,
where a ‘frame’ is a block of data sent or received by a computer
at the data link layer of the OSI reference model of Figure 4.4).
With TDMA, carriers are transmitted in bursts and received in
bursts. Every burst consists of a header made of two sequences
of bits: one for carrier and bit timing acquisition by the receiving
VSAT demodulator, another named ‘unique word’ indicating to
the receiver the start of the data ﬁeld. The header is followed
by a data ﬁeld containing the trafﬁc associated with either one
or several one-way connections. If only one, the burst is a
Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC) burst, if several, the burst
is a Multiple Channel Per Carrier (MCPC) burst and is divided
into subbursts, each subburst corresponding to one one-way
connection. Synchronisation is necessary between earth stations,
and the earth station must be equipped with rapid acquisition
demodulators in order to limit burst preambles to a minimum.
– Code division multiple access (CDMA) is a multiple access technique
which does not consider any frequency–time partition: carriers
are allowed to be transmitted continuously while occupying
the full transponder bandwidth, B. Therefore interference is
inevitable, but is resolved by using spread spectrum transmission
techniques based on the generation of high-rate chip sequences
(or ‘code’), one for every transmitted carrier. These sequences
should be orthogonal so as to limit interference. Such techniques

NETWORKING ASPECTS

131

allow the receiver to reject the received interference and retrieve
the wanted message.
The selection of a multiple access scheme should take into account
the requirement for power and bandwidth, not only of the satellite
transponder, but also of the earth stations (VSATs and hub station).
Generally speaking, operating a satellite transponder in a multicarrier mode (several carriers sharing the transponder bandwidth
at a given time) as with FDMA and CDMA, entails the generation of intermodulation noise which adds to the thermal noise (see
Chapter 5, section 5.4). Carriers conveying a high bit rate are more
demanding for bandwidth and power than smaller carriers. This
impacts on the EIRP requirement of the transmitter: it translates into
a higher demand for power from VSAT transmitters on the inbound
links, from the hub station transmitter on the outbound links, and
from the satellite transponder on all links. It also translates into a
higher demand for bandwidth on the satellite transponder.
We will now discuss the practical implementation of these multiple access schemes in VSAT networks. It will be assumed that
a fraction of a satellite transponder bandwidth is allocated to the
VSAT network, hence it may be that the rest of the transponder
is occupied by carriers originating from earth stations other than
those belonging to the considered VSAT network. Indeed, it seldom happens that the demand for capacity of a VSAT network
requires full transponder usage. Therefore, the transponder is actually divided into subbands, every subband being used by different
networks. In a way this represents ‘network FDMA’. This means
that the satellite resource available to a given network is only a
fraction of a satellite transponder’s overall resource, as not only the
transponder bandwidth has to be shared but also the output power.
Therefore, a considered VSAT network beneﬁts neither from the
entire transponder effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP), nor
from its full bandwidth.

4.6.2

Meshed networks

The meshed network comprises N VSATs. Every VSAT should be
able to establish a link to any other one across the satellite.
A ﬁrst approach is to have every VSAT transmitting as many
carriers as there are other VSATs: the information conveyed on
every carrier represents the trafﬁc on a one-way connection from
one user terminal attached to one of the VSATs to another user
terminal attached to another VSAT. Such carriers are Single Channel

Figure 4.14 Meshed network with N VSATs transmitting as many SCPC carriers as there are other VSATs, using Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)

Per Carrier (SCPC) carriers. A two-way connection between two
user terminals entails the use of two SCPC carriers, each one being
transmitted by each of the involved VSATs. For permanent full
network connectivity, every VSAT should be able to receive at
any time all SCPC carriers transmitted by the other VSATs in
the network.
Figure 4.14 proposes an implementation based on FDMA. Such
a conﬁguration requires that every VSAT be equipped with N − 1
transmitters and N − 1 receivers. This is costly if N is large, and poses
operational difﬁculties as more transmitters and receivers must be
installed at every VSAT each time the network incorporates new
VSATs. Moreover, the satellite transponder is occupied by N(N − 1)
carriers. Such carriers are narrow band ones as they convey low bit
rates. This may require frequency stable modulators because guard
bands between carriers must be kept to a minimum in order to
save satellite bandwidth. As an example, consider a VSAT network
with N = 100 VSATs. The number of transmitters and receivers per
VSAT is N − 1 = 99. The number of carriers is N(N − 1) = 9900.
A variant of Figure 4.14 is to consider the broadcasting capability
of the satellite: any carrier uplinked by a VSAT is actually received
by all VSATs. Therefore, the overall trafﬁc conveyed by the N − 1
carriers transmitted by a given VSAT in Figure 4.14 can be multiplexed onto a unique Multiple Channels Per Carrier (MCPC) carrier.
Receiving that carrier, any VSAT can demodulate it and extract from
the baseband multiplex the trafﬁc dedicated to the user terminals
attached to it. Now, every VSAT still needs N − 1 receivers, but only

Figure 4.15 Variant of Figure 4.14 where the overall traffic from a VSAT to
all other VSATs is multiplexed on a single carrier

one transmitter. However, the capacity of the transmitted carrier
is higher, thus the VSAT transmitter must be more powerful. This
scheme is represented in Figure 4.15.
The problem of having many receivers and transmitters comes
from the requirement for permanent full connectivity. Actually,
there is seldom need for such a requirement: indeed, apart from
some broadcasting applications, the customer usually only requests
that temporary two-way connections be set up between any two
remote terminals attached to two different VSATs in the network.
This works out most conveniently through demand assignment (see
Chapter 1, section 1.5.3): should a terminal ask for such a connection,
then the VSAT it is attached to sends a request on a signalling channel
to a trafﬁc control station, which replies by allocating some of the
available satellite resource to both the calling and the called VSATs.
With FDMA, this resource consists of two subbands on the satellite
transponder, one for each carrier transmitted by the two VSATs. So
any VSAT needs only to be equipped with one transmitter and one
receiver, both tunable on request to any potential frequency band
allocation within the transponder bandwidth.
Should now TDMA be used in Figure 4.15 instead of FDMA,
then permanent full connectivity can be achieved with only one
carrier being transmitted and received by every VSAT. This looks
appealing but one must consider the higher cost of the TDMA
equipment, and the fact that permanent full connectivity is not
really needed.
With CDMA, the analysis follows the same lines as with FDMA.
With demand assignment, temporary connections are set up by
allocating to every transmitting VSAT a speciﬁc code. However,
there does not seem to be any advantage to using CDMA apart from

134

NETWORKING ASPECTS

for small VSAT networks operating at C-band. CDMA then offers
protection against interference generated by other systems.
Most of today’s commercial meshed networks are based on
demand assignment FDMA.

4.6.3

Star-shaped networks

The star-shaped network comprises N VSATs and a hub. Every
VSAT can transmit up to K carriers, corresponding to connections
between terminals attached to the VSAT and the corresponding
applications at the host computer connected to the hub station.

4.6.3.1 FDMA–SCPC inbound/FDMA–SCPC outbound
Figure 4.16 illustrates the case where two-way connections between
any remote user terminal and the host computer are supported by
means of two Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC) carriers: one from
the VSAT to the hub station, and one from the hub to the VSAT.
Every carrier requires its own modulator and demodulator. Hence,
this conﬁguration requires K modulators and demodulators at every
VSAT and KN modulators and demodulators at the hub station. This
is costly if the number of VSATs is large and K larger than 1. For
instance, with N = 100 and K = 3, three hundred modulators and
demodulators are to be installed at the hub.
With demand assignment, frequency agility is required for both
transmitting and receiving VSATs.

135

4.6.3.2 FDMA–SCPC inbound/FDMA–MCPC outbound
Considering that any carrier transmitted by the hub is received by
all VSATs, the number of modulators at the hub can be reduced,
as indicated in Figure 4.17, by time division multiplexing the trafﬁc
from the hub to one VSAT on an outbound Multiple Channels Per
Carrier (MCPC) carrier. The number of modulators at the hub is
now equal to the number, N, of VSATs.
As the number of multiplexed connections on any outbound
carrier may vary with time, the hub modulators and VSAT demodulators must be able to accommodate variable rates. The transmitted
rate from the hub is higher with MCPC carriers. This translates into
a higher demand for power from the hub transmitter.
With demand assignment, frequency agility is required for transmitting VSATs only.

4.6.3.3 FDMA–SCPC inbound/TDM–MCPC outbound
The number of modulators at the hub and demodulators at the
VSATs can even be reduced to one, as illustrated in Figure 4.18,
by time division multiplexing all connections from the hub to the
VSATs on one MCPC outbound carrier. The hub modulator and
the VSAT demodulator can operate at constant bit rate, equal to the
maximum capacity of the network. But as a result of the higher bit
rate, the demand for power from the hub transmitter is increased.

The large inbalance in input power between the low powered
inbound carriers and the high powered outbound carrier results
in a ‘capture effect’ at the output of the satellite transponder, when
used near saturation: the outbound carrier has a larger share of
the output transponder power than its share at the input [MAR02,
p. 452]. Therefore, less power is available to the inbound carriers.
With demand assignment, frequency agility is required for transmitting VSATs only.

4.6.3.4 FDMA–MCPC inbound/TDM–MCPC outbound
The number of modulators at the VSATs can be reduced to one, as
illustrated in Figure 4.19, by time division multiplexing the trafﬁc
on the K inbound carriers from every VSAT to the hub station onto
a single MCPC carrier. As the number of multiplexed connections
on the inbound link may vary with time, the VSAT modulator must
be at variable rate. Also, as the transmission rate is higher, the VSAT
transmitter must be more powerful. The hub station needs to be
equipped with N demodulators only.
With demand assignment, frequency agility is required for transmitting VSATs only.

Figure 4.20. Each burst may convey the trafﬁc of either one oneway connection (SCPC) or several one-way connections (MCPC). In
the latter case, the burst is divided into subbursts, each subburst
being associated with one one-way connection. Denoting by TB the
duration of a carrier burst and by TF the duration of the TDMA
frame, any VSAT transmits with a duty cycle TB /TF .
The capacity of a radio frequency link from a VSAT is equal to the
number of transmitted bits per unit of time. In a TDMA scheme, if

a VSAT is to beneﬁt from the same radio frequency link capacity as
with FDMA, then it has to transmit at a higher bit rate. Indeed, with
FDMA, the radio frequency link capacity is equal to the continuous
transmitted bit rate. With TDMA, the radio frequency link capacity
of the VSAT is given by the number of bits transmitted per TDMA
frame duration.
As can be seen from Figure 4.21, where RTDMA and RFDMA are
the transmitted bit rates for, respectively, TDMA and FDMA, TB is
the burst duration and TF the TDMA frame duration, the number
of bits transmitted per frame duration is equal to RTDMA TB for
TDMA, while it is equal to RFDMA TF for FDMA. Equating these two
expressions leads to:
 
TF
(4.17)
RTDMA = RFDMA
TB
Clearly the transmission rate is higher by a factor equal to the
inverse of the duty cycle. If one neglects guard time between bursts,
the inverse of the duty cycle is equal to the number of VSATs in the
network. Therefore, for a given capacity, a large number of VSATs
entails a high bit rate transmission.
It will be shown in Chapter 5 that the power of the carrier is
proportional to the bit rate. Therefore, TDMA demands more power
than FDMA from the VSAT transmitters.
Consider, for instance, a VSAT network with N = 50 VSATs, each
with a radio frequency link capacity of 64 kbs−1 . With FDMA, all
VSATs transmit at RFDMA = 64 kbs−1 , and the satellite transponder
bandwidth has to support 50 × 64 kbs−1 = 3.2 Mbs−1 . With TDMA,
the same bandwidth would be used but now all VSATs would be
requested to transmit at a rate of 3.2 Mbs−1 , thus increasing the
demand for power by a factor of 50, or 17 dB, which is beyond
the capability of cheap VSATs. Therefore, it would be necessary to
reduce the capacity of every VSAT.

NETWORKING ASPECTS

139

The following scheme, which is a hybrid combining FDMA and
TDMA, brings some ﬂexibility to a cost effective design.

4.6.3.6 FDMA–TDMA inbound/FDMA–MCPC outbound
In order to lower the requirement on the VSAT transmitter power by
reducing the transmitted bit rate, an elegant solution is to organise
VSATs into groups, with L VSATs per group, a group sharing
the same frequency band and accessing the satellite transponder
in a TDMA mode. The different groups use different frequency
bands: this is a combined FDMA–TDMA scheme, as illustrated in
Figure 4.22. With this approach, given the number N of VSATs in
the network and capacity per VSAT, the transmitted bit rate on the
carrier burst, and hence the required carrier power, is divided by G,
the number of groups.
For instance, in the previous example, by splitting the 50 VSATs
into 5 groups of 10 VSATs, the transmitted bit rate reduces from
3.2 Mbs−1 for pure TDMA to 640 kbs−1 , and the increase in power
demand compared to pure FDMA is only 10 dB instead of 17 dB.
It may be convenient to consider time division multiplexing of all
connections from hub to VSATs of the same group on one MCPC
outbound carrier. The MCPC outbound carriers for the different

groups then access the transponder in an FDMA mode. This reduces
the bit rate transmitted by the hub, and hence its transmitter power,
and offers the network manager the opportunity of implementing
groups of VSATs as independent networks sharing a common hub.

4.6.3.7 CDMA
Figure 4.23 illustrates the variety of schemes that can be considered
in connection with full CDMA access, or a combination of CDMA
and FDMA for the inbound and the outbound links. CDMA access
can also be combined with SCPC or MCPC by grouping inbound
connections.
With CDMA, carriers are assigned spreading pseudo-random
codes instead of frequencies because all carriers use the same centre
frequency. Hence frequency agility is no longer needed for demand
assignment, eliminating the problem caused by frequency instability
and phase noise encountered by SCPC/FDMA carriers that require
precise frequency assignments. The major drawback to CDMA is its
low throughput [MAR02, section 6.6.5 p 315] which can be accepted

only if it is balanced by the advantages gained from rejection of
interference caused by other systems sharing the same frequency
bands and polarisation.

4.6.4

Fixed assignment versus demand assignment

Demand assignment has been presented in Chapter 1, section 1.6.3
as an appealing option within VSAT networks. It has been shown
in the context of meshed networks (see section 4.6.2) that demand
assignment permits implementing the desired connectivity between
VSATs by setting up temporary links, with reduced VSAT equipment compared to ﬁxed assignment allowing permanent links.
Therefore, it is interesting to discuss the impact of demand assignment, compared to ﬁxed assignment, in a general sense.

4.6.4.1 Fixed assignment with FDMA (FA–FDMA)
The network comprises L VSATs, each possibly transmitting up
to K carriers at bit rate Rc . So we have at most L = KN carriers,
and every carrier is allocated a given subband of the satellite
transponder bandwidth. This subband is used by a VSAT when
active (carrier ‘on’), and remains unused when the VSAT has no
trafﬁc to convey (carrier ‘off’). Should this happen, the capacity
corresponding to the subband allocated to the VSAT is lost to the
network. Figure 4.24 illustrates how ﬁxed assignment works for
FDMA in the case where K = 1.
Fixed assignment has the advantage of simplicity, and provides
no blocking nor waiting time for setting up a carrier. However, the
required capacity for the VSAT network, equal to LRc , is poorly
utilised if the trafﬁc demand is highly variable.
Blocking may occur at a user terminal attached to a given VSAT
should several of these terminals wish to establish connections
simultaneously with other terminals in the network, and the number
of requested connections exceed the capacity of the VSAT.
For instance, consider the VSAT network of Figure 4.16, with
Nt = 8 user terminals per VSAT, N = 50 VSATs and up to K = 4
SCPC carriers per VSAT, each transmitting at bit rate Rc = 128 kbs−1
and requiring bandwidth b = 200 kHz. The transponder bandwidth
used by the inbound links is split into L = KN = 4 × 50 = 200
subbands. Every subband is allocated to one 128 kbs−1 carrier.
Therefore, the required network capacity is LRc = 200 × 128 kbs−1 =
25.6 Mbs−1 , and the required bandwidth is Lb = 200 × 200 kHz =

40 MHz. Assuming user terminals generate trafﬁc with intensity
At = 0.1 erlang, then the trafﬁc intensity offered to the K = 4 VSAT
channels’ capacity is AVSAT = Nt At = 0.8 erlang. The probability of
blocking, as given by formula (4.5), is equal to:
E4 (0.8) = 8 × 10−3 = 0.8%
In order to avoid any blocking, each user terminal should be permanently allocated a channel, this would imply K = 8, and therefore
a total of KN = 8 × 50 = 400 SCPC carriers. The required network
capacity would then be KNRc = 8 × 50 × 128 kbs−1 = 51.2 Mbs−1 ,
and the required transponder bandwidth would be 80 MHz.

4.6.4.2 Demand assignment with FDMA (DA–FDMA)
The network again comprises N VSATs, each possibly transmitting
K carriers, and sharing a pool of L frequency subbands, but now
L < KN. These subbands are used by the active VSATs. Figure 4.25
illustrates how demand assignment works for FDMA in the case
where K = 1. Should the number of carriers exceed the number that
can be supported by the allocated satellite transponder bandwidth,
then there is blocking at the VSAT level: at the time of the call, no
new carrier can be established.

Figure 4.25 Demand assignment FDMA (K = 1)

For example, again consider the VSAT network of Figure 4.16,
with Nt = 8 user terminals per VSAT, and up to K = 4 SCPC carriers
per VSAT, each transmitting at bit rate Rc = 128 kbs−1 and requiring
bandwidth b = 200 kHz. Assuming user terminals generate trafﬁc
with intensity At = 0.1 erlang, then the trafﬁc intensity offered to
the K = 4 VSAT channels’ capacity is AVSAT = Nt At = 0.8 erlang.
Assuming again N = 50 VSATs, at a given time at most K terminals
per VSAT generate trafﬁc, so the trafﬁc intensity offered to the
L subbands is A = NKAt = 50 × 4 × 0.1 = 20 erlang. The blocking
probability for setting up a link can be maintained at a low level by
having a sufﬁciently large pool of subbands. For instance, using (4.5),
and taking L = 35 subbands, the carrier set-up blocking probability
is E35 (20) = 7 × 10−4 = 0.07%.
A call is blocked either because a terminal cannot access any one
of the K channels, or because the VSAT cannot access any one of the
L subbands. The probability for a call to be blocked is given by:
Pblocked = E4 (0.8) + E35 (20)
= 8 × 10−3 + 7 × 10−4
= 0.87%
The required network capacity is now LRc = 35 × 128 kbs−1 =
4.48 Mbs−1 , and the required bandwidth is Lb = 35 × 200 kHz =

144

NETWORKING ASPECTS

7 MHz. Therefore, with a negligible increase in call blocking probability, demand assignment offers a potential saving of 100(1 −
L/KN)% = 100(1 − 35/200) = 82.5% of the used satellite transponder bandwidth.

4.6.4.3 Fixed assignment with TDMA (FA–TDMA)
Figure 4.26 illustrates ﬁxed assignment in connection with TDMA
operation. Every VSAT transmits a carrier burst within a dedicated
time slot. The number of time slots is equal to the number, L,
of VSATs. Position and duration of bursts are ﬁxed, therefore the
capacity of every VSAT is constant whatever the trafﬁc demand.
If Rc is the transmitted bit rate, then the total network capacity is
Rc , and the capacity allocated to a VSAT is Rc /L. Should a VSAT
have no trafﬁc to transmit, then the slot remains unoccupied, and
the corresponding capacity is lost for the network.
Fixed assignment has the advantage of simplicity, and provides no
blocking nor waiting time for setting up a carrier. However, the total
network capacity of the VSAT network (transponder bandwidth
allocated to the network) is poorly utilised if the trafﬁc demand is
highly variable.
Blocking may occur at the user terminal. The blocking probability
can be calculated following derivations similar to that of the example
of ﬁxed assignment with FDMA. One can assume that the carrier
burst is split into K subbursts, each corresponding to one channel
available to the attached user terminals.

Considering, as previously, L = 50, K = 4, Nt = 8 and At = 0.1
erlang, the blocking probability for a terminal is E4 (0.8) = 8 × 10−3 =
0.8%, as previously.
It is worth recalling that in order to achieve comparable capacities
per VSAT, the value of Rc must be increased by a factor L relative to
the FDMA scheme (see equation (4.17)).

4.6.4.4 Demand assignment with TDMA (DA–TDMA)
Figure 4.27 shows how the L time slots of the frame are now shared
by N VSATs, with N > L. Any VSAT wishing to set up a link
(carrier ‘on’ from carrier ‘off’ state) can access any unoccupied time
slot on the frame, or should it already be active, it can increase its
capacity by increasing the duration of its burst, and then support a
larger number of connections. This requires a change in the burst
time plan, and is performed under the control of the network
management system (NMS) at the hub station.
As the trafﬁc demand from all VSATs may exceed the offered
capacity Rc , blocking of link set-up may occur as a result of the
TDMA frame being ﬁlled with carrier bursts.
For example, the network capacity KL = 4 × 50 = 200 channels
considered in the above FA–TDMA scheme is now available as
a pool to all user terminals, whose total trafﬁc intensity is A =
N × 8 × 0.1 = 0.8 N erlang, where N is the number of VSATs in
the network. For a comparison with FA–TDMA, N can be selected

so as to achieve a 0.8% blocking probability for a terminal. This
means solving E200 (A) = 0.8%, which corresponds to A = 178 erlang.
Therefore N = 178/0.8 = 222, which indicates that the number of
VSATs in the network can be increased by a factor 222/50 = 4.4.

4.6.4.5 Demand assignment multiple access
(DAMA) procedure
With demand assignment, a VSAT receives a call demand from one
of the user terminals attached to it. This is indicated in Figure 4.28
as ‘call arrival time’. This call may concern:
1. An application at the host computer attached to the hub, or
2. A user terminal attached to some other VSAT in the network.
As illustrated in Figure 4.28, the VSAT then sends a request to the
hub by means of a speciﬁc inbound signalling channel, and the hub
allocates the requested capacity, if available, to the corresponding
VSAT by means of response messages transmitted on an outbound

signalling channel, and conveying capacity assignments (carrier
frequency, time slot or code).
If the connection is between a user terminal and the host computer, the delay of the incoming response is a two-hop delay, plus
processing time. If the connection is between two user terminals, the
hub transmits an assignment to the destination terminal and waits
for a call acceptance message. This avoids assigning capacity to the
incoming call before making sure the call can be accepted by the
destination terminal. Then the hub assigns capacity to the calling
VSAT. The connection set-up then takes a four-hop delay plus processing time. Once the connection is established from terminal to
terminal, the hub acts as a relay.
Demand assignment requires that some network capacity be
dedicated to request and response signalling. Moreover, some reservation delay is to be expected as a result of the time for signalling to
be routed and processed.
When the access of VSATs to the signalling channel is organised
according to a ﬁxed assignment scheme, the need for limiting the
capacity of the signalling channel to a reasonable fraction of the total
network capacity will limit the number of VSATs in the network.
In order to avoid such a limitation and offer the possibility of easy
addition of new VSATs to the network, a random access scheme to
the signalling channel is often preferred.

4.6.4.6 Demand assignment limitations
From the above, it can be seen that demand assignment allows more
VSATs to share the satellite resource, or, for a given network size,
allows a reduction in the utilised satellite bandwidth. Also to be
considered is the penalty for signalling capacity. However, it can be
kept small enough.
Of greater concern is the time delay: a message must wait at the
VSAT before being transmitted while requests are forwarded and
channel allocation is completed. As a result of propagation time and
processing time, the delay may be as high as one to two seconds.
This is not compatible with efﬁcient transmission of short messages
which constitute bursty trafﬁc, should a connection be set up every
time a message comes in.
To illustrate the problem, consider Figure 4.29 where the connection set-up delay is compared to the transmission time of a message
(also called ‘service time’). Table 4.1 indicates that the typical message length for bursty trafﬁc is a few hundred bytes. Consider, for
example, a message length of 200 bytes, the service time at a rate

Figure 4.29 Overhead delay associated with connection set-up and idle
time during connection for the case of a long message and for that of a

of 64 kbs−1 is 25 ms. If one considers a connection set-up delay of
1.5 s, then the overhead delay before transmission of the message is
as large as 60 times the message transmission time.
Moreover, with bursty trafﬁc the temporary connection established on demand for message transfer is poorly utilised as a result
of idle times. The greater the burstiness, the worse the problem.
Indeed, considering an information transmission rate Rb and a message length L, the service time is τ = L/Rb . If we denote by IAT the
average interarrival time, and recall the expression for burstiness
from (4.9):

(4.19)

NETWORKING ASPECTS

149

For instance, considering a value BU = 10 000, the channel utilisation is 10−4 = 0.01%. With such a low utilisation of the channel,
the advantage gained in terms of capacity reduction from demand
assignment is lost.
Bursty trafﬁc is routed most efﬁciently if:
– VSATs transmit at once whenever they get trafﬁc from the user
terminals. This forbids any connection set-up delay;
– the capacity derived from the utilisation of transponder bandwidth is shared between all VSATs to allow statistical multiplexing of the bursts.
These conditions are satisﬁed in random time division multiple
access schemes, often named ALOHA.

4.6.5

Random time division multiple access

4.6.5.1 Principle
Random time division multiple access, also named ALOHA,
has been introduced in section 4.6.1. There are two modes:
unslotted ALOHA, and slotted ALOHA (S-ALOHA) [HA86
p362–378][SCH77, Chapter 13]. With unslotted ALOHA, VSATs can
transmit at any time, which means that they are not synchronised.
With S-ALOHA, VSATs transmit in time slots, which means that
they are synchronised but not coordinated, in the sense that while
transmitting in a given time slot they ignore whether other VSATs
are transmitting or not in the same time slot.
Figure 4.30 illustrates the principle of S-ALOHA. Every carrier is
transmitted in the form of a burst with duration equal to that of a time
slot. Every carrier burst conveys a packet of data. Synchronisation
between VSATs is derived from the signals transmitted by the hub
station and received on the outbound link.
Transmission of a packet is initiated by a message being generated
by a user terminal attached to the VSAT. The length of the message
may not coincide with the length of a packet. If too small, it must
be completed by dummy bits. If too large, it must be conveyed over
several packets. As users are not coordinated, messages as well as
carrier bursts are generated at random.
The transmission efﬁciency of the S-ALOHA protocol is measured
by the normalised throughput S, expressed in number of packets
successfully transmitted per packet length. The average rate of

It can be shown [TAN89 p 22], [HA86 p 362] that S depends on the
average offered trafﬁc, G (in packets per packet length), consisting
of newly generated and retransmitted packets, and the number, N,
of VSATs in the network:


G N−1
S=G 1−
(4.21)
N
As N becomes inﬁnite, the above expression becomes:
S = G e−G

(4.22)

These equations are represented in Figure 4.31.
From Figure 4.31, one can see that the normalised throughput converges rapidly to the inﬁnite population case and that the maximum
normalised throughput for an inﬁnite number of VSATs is equal to
1/e = 0.368, or 37%, which is poor.
With unslotted ALOHA, expression (4.22) is replaced by:
S = G e−2G

(4.23)

which leads to similar curves, but with an even lower maximum
normalised throughput Smax = 1/2e = 0.184 = 18%.

The low throughput of ALOHA schemes could be expected as
VSATs may transmit at random in any time slot. The advantage of
S-ALOHA is a higher throughput than unslotted ALOHA, and, as
will be demonstrated in section 4.6.6, a lower average delay at low
throughput (i.e. with highly bursty trafﬁc), than that achieved with
demand assignment FDMA or TDMA.
For a given transmission bit rate Rc (bs−1 ), the number, N, of VSATs
that can be installed in the network given the packet generation rate,
λ(s−1 ), per VSAT and the length, L, of a packet relates to the
normalised throughput, S:

The above expression is displayed in Figure 4.32 for various packet
lengths and practical values of S = 0.1, and Rc = 64 kbs−1 .

4.6.5.2 Random access limitations
Instability
Packets suffering collisions must be retransmitted. VSATs awaiting retransmission are said to be ‘backlogged’. The retransmitted
packets generate an excess of trafﬁc which adds to the newly generated packets. Therefore, the offered trafﬁc G exceeds the successful
trafﬁc, or throughput S. Referring to Figure 4.31, should the value
of G exceed one, which corresponds to the maximum value of S,
then as the throughput S decreases for any increase of G, collisions

S = 0.1 is considered, and a transmission bit rate Rc = 64 kbs−1

become even more frequent and the network evolves towards a
situation of high G and low S where VSATs constantly retransmit
the same packets.
Retransmission procedures are:
1. Fixed retransmission probability: the backlogged terminal retransmits a packet with a ﬁxed probability during each slot. This
is simple but may be unstable.
2. Adaptive strategies: the feedback channel is observed and the
retransmission probability is adapted according to the history of
the channel.
3. Heuristic retransmission: the retransmission probability is adjusted according to the number of retransmission attempts that
have already been performed for the current packet.
In order to avoid instability, the design of a VSAT network should
consider a practical throughput S of 5 to 15%. Figure 4.32, which
considers S = 0.1 can be used to determine the appropriate number
of VSATs.
Long message case
Successful transmission of long messages generated by the user
terminals entails successful transmission of several consecutive

NETWORKING ASPECTS

153

packets. It can be shown that the throughput of an S-ALOHA
scheme when long messages made of many consecutive packets
must be retransmitted is given by:
S=

G e−G
1 + G2

(4.25)

The above formula indicates that the throughput compared to the
case of single packet S-ALOHA, as given by expression (4.22), is
lowered by a factor (1 + G2 ), and has a maximum value of 0.137 at
G = 0.414.
In order to overcome the above limitations, variants of the random
time division multiple access schemes have been proposed and will
now be presented.

4.6.5.3 Selective reject ALOHA
Messages are transmitted asynchronously as in unslotted ALOHA,
but are partitioned into a ﬁnite number of short packets, each with
its own acquisition preamble and header. The protocol exploits the
fact that on an unslotted channel most collisions are partial, so
that uncollided portions of messages encountering conﬂict can be
recovered by the receiver, and only the packets actually encountering conﬂict are retransmitted, in a way similar to the selective
repeat protocol of Figure 4.7(c). The maximum throughput has been
shown to approach 0.368, irrespective of the message length distribution. In practice, the need for acquisition preamble and header
in each packet limits the maximum useful throughput to the range
of 0.2–0.3. The critical need for low packet overhead requires burst
modems with short acquisition times.

4.6.5.4 Reservation/random TDMA
The inbound packets are transmitted in the time slots of a TDMA
frame. This TDMA frame is shared by a group of VSATs in the
network, as illustrated in Figure 4.22. The S-ALOHA protocol is
used to convey messages short enough to be sent in a single packet.
When an arriving message exceeds the slot size, a request for the
necessary number of dedicated slots is made via S-ALOHA, while
the remaining packets are queued at the VSAT waiting for a time
slot assignment message from the hub for the remaining part of the
message. All participating VSATs receiving the outbound carrier
from the hub are informed of the speciﬁc slots reserved for the
requesting VSAT and will refrain from transmitting packets in these

154

NETWORKING ASPECTS

slots. The requesting VSAT now can transmit the remaining part of
the message without collision.
The maximum number of time slots in a TDMA frame to be used
for reservation is limited to a predetermined value so that a certain
number of slots are always kept free for random use. This precludes
the occurrence of a lockout situation.
The requests for reservation can be either transmitted within
a speciﬁc time slot divided into smaller slots, to be used on a
contention basis with the ALOHA technique, within dedicated time
slots, or piggy backed on the ﬁrst packet of the message. Figure 4.33
illustrates the latter case.
The arrival of a long message triggers the emission of a reservation message. Should the transmission of reservation messages
be achieved on a contention basis using the S-ALOHA protocol,
a high degree of correlation exists between the reservation trafﬁc
ﬂuctuations and the data trafﬁc load. This correlation may generate
instability, as data trafﬁc may display high instantaneous ﬂuctuations. To alleviate the problems caused by the correlation, it has been
proposed that a reservation message convey reservation requests
for more than one data message [ZEI91]. Not only does this reduce
the load of the reservation channel, but the reservation protocol
becomes unconditionally stable by simply indicating in the reservation message the number of data slots required for all the data
messages waiting in the buffer of the VSAT.

4.6.5.5 Random access with notification
Satellite transponder capacity is divided into two portions: a signalling channel shared in ﬁxed TDMA mode by multiple VSATs,
each with a dedicated signalling slot, and a data channel to carry
all data packets. Signalling and data channels are divided into ﬁxed
duration frames, and each frame is divided into a number of time

slots. Frames and slots are numbered and synchronised among all
VSATs via centralised control from the hub.
For the data channel, two types of slot are considered: random
access and reservation. New packets use random access slots, while
collided and errored packets will be allotted reserved slots. Over
the separate TDMA signalling channel, every VSAT notiﬁes the hub
of the number of packets transmitted by the VSAT in a particular
frame. If a packet experiences a collision, the hub recognises that
the number of packets successfully received is less than the number
that were reported as sent. The hub then allots the required number
of slots to the VSAT in some future frame for contention-free
retransmission in the reservation mode.

4.6.6

Delay analysis

Delay means the time it takes for a message to be transferred from
the user terminal to the host computer. The delay is a random
variable, and it is common to characterise it by its average value.
However, for many applications it is not sufﬁcient to design a VSAT
network on the basis of the average delay. Quantities such as the
95th percentile of delay are of equal or greater signiﬁcance.
For delay analysis, it is assumed that every user generates messages according to a Poisson process (see Appendix 1). Messages
are stored at the VSAT in a buffer of inﬁnite capacity. A message
is transmitted by the VSAT to the hub in the form of packets with
length L.

4.6.6.1 Delay components
The message delay components for the inbound link and the outbound link are as follows:
1. Delays at the VSAT:
– polling and/or queuing at the VSAT-to-user terminal interface;
– VSAT processing delay (formatting of packets);
– protocol induced delays: with random access, this is the
waiting time for retransmission if a collision has been encountered; with demand assignment, this is the waiting time for
allocation;
– time to send messages, called service time, which depends on
the message size and the bit rate.

156

NETWORKING ASPECTS

2. Satellite link transmission delay: this corresponds to the propagation time of the carrier, and is given in Figure 2.22.
3. Delays at the hub:
– polling and/or queuing at the hub-to-host interface;
– hub processing delay (formatting of packets);
– time to send messages, called service time, which depends on
the message size and the bit rate.
The results presented below deal with packet delay, deﬁned as the
elapsed time between the instant when a packet is being transmitted
by a source VSAT to the instant when the last byte of the packet is
received by the destination hub. Processing time at the VSAT and at
the hub is neglected.
It should be remarked that the considered packet delay is induced
by the multiple access protocol only. It does not include delays
possibly induced by retransmissions initiated by the data link control
protocol. However, if the bit error rate on the satellite link is low
enough, and selection of an appropriate data link control protocol
has been made, retransmissions due to errors are rare. It can then
be considered that the packet delay induced by the multiple access
protocol is representative of the actual delay.

4.6.6.2 Comparison of FDMA, TDMA and S-ALOHA
Expressions for the average packet delay are as follows:

If the network has N VSATs and every VSAT transmits K carriers,
then the total network capacity is R = NKRFDMA . Therefore, RFDMA =

number of VSATs sharing the network capacity R = RTDMA .
If the network has N VSATs, every VSAT transmits at a rate
RTDMA , equal to the network capacity R, and its time share of the
capacity is RTDMA /N.

Assuming there is no call blocking, the requested connection is set
up after an initial delay equal to the round trip propagation delay,
equal to 2Tp (about 0.5 s). Once the connection is set up, the above
formulas are applicable.

(s): τ = L/RTDMA , where RTDMA is the carrier transmission rate (bs−1 ),
G the offered trafﬁc load (packet per time slot) and k the maximum
retransmission interval (time slots).
Figure 4.34 displays packet delay curves for a constant length
packet trafﬁc, with packet length L = 1000 bits, and packet generation rate λ = 0.1 s−1 as a function of the number of VSATs in
the network. Three multiple access protocols are compared: FDMA
with delay given by (4.27), TDMA with delay given by (4.29) and
S-ALOHA with delay given by (4.30). For FDMA, it is assumed
that a VSAT transmits one carrier only (K = 1). For S-ALOHA,
three values of the maximum retransmission interval have been
selected: k = 10, 50 and 100 slots. The network capacity is constant and equal to R = 100 kbs−1 . Thus, RFDMA = 100 kbs−1 /KN =
100 kbs−1 /N, and RTDMA = R = 100 kbs−1 . The TDMA frame duration TF varies with the number of VSATs: TF = (number of VSATs) ×
L/RTDMA = number of VSATs × 10−3 seconds.
Clearly, S-ALOHA delivers a shorter delay than FDMA and
TDMA. This demonstrates its greater ability to convey bursty trafﬁc.

the selected values, S = 10−3 N. A safe design with the S-ALOHA
protocol would be to limit the number of stations to below, say, 150,
in order to maintain the throughput value below 15%.
It is also of interest to view the average packet delay when the size
of the network is given. Equations (4.27), (4.29) and (4.30) are used
again for two network sizes: 50 VSATs (Figure 4.35) and 100 VSATs
(Figure 4.36). In both ﬁgures the total network capacity is the same
as in Figure 4.34, i.e. R = 100 kbs−1 .

4.6.6.3 Comparison of other protocols
Figure 4.37 presents a comparison of the delay performance of
selective reject ALOHA with that of unslotted ALOHA, S-ALOHA
and DAMA/TDMA [RAY88]. The latter corresponds to the variant
of the reservation/random TDMA protocol where the requests for
reservation are transmitted within a speciﬁc time slot divided into
smaller slots, to be used on a contention basis using S-ALOHA.

all its competitors at low throughput (small size networks). As
throughput increases (larger size networks), reservation/random
TDMA displays a lower delay.
Figure 4.38 presents results obtained for the other variant of
reservation/random TDMA protocol, where a reservation message
is piggy backed on the ﬁrst packet of the message [FUJ86]. A mixture
of random access trafﬁc (short data) and reservation trafﬁc (long
data) are transmitted. In the case shown here, the delay for the
short data is minimised in spite of the coexistence of relatively large
amounts of long data even where total slot utilisation is as high
as 40%.
Figure 4.39 presents results obtained for the random access with
notiﬁcation (RAN) protocol [CHI88]. It can be seen that the RAN
protocol has a better average delay than reservation TDMA, up
to approximately 64% throughput, at which point the number of
random access slots reaches zero and the protocol changes to a pure
demand assignment TDMA scheme.

Conclusion

The above discussion provides guidelines for the selection of the
multiple access technique appropriate to a given trafﬁc type. It
should be kept in mind that the selection of such a technique should

maintain the minimum implementation cost compatible with the
required performance.
The combined FDMA–TDMA scheme of Figure 4.22 offers a convenient trade-off between the utilised transponder bandwidth and
the power requirement for VSAT transmitters. It also allows a ﬂexible implementation of techniques, from demand assignment to pure
random access.
– For stream trafﬁc, demand assigned TDMA offers a high throughput at the expense of an acceptable delay.
– For bursty trafﬁc, a dedicated connection would be poorly used,
and random time division multiple access is more efﬁcient.
S-ALOHA offers low delay at high burstiness, and can be combined with reservation techniques in order to avoid the inherent
limitations of S-ALOHA at low burstiness.
These techniques are used in most present VSAT networks that
support a mix of both interactive and batch applications.
CDMA is well suited for low data rate applications, to meet
interference restrictions, and for applications that require spectrum spreading for frequency coordination (for instance C-band
VSAT networks).
Other protocols, not discussed here because they are too complex
for a cost effective implementation in VSAT networks, have been
proposed. The extensive overview provided by [RAY87] makes a
highly recommendable reference.

NETWORK DESIGN
Principles

Network design aims to translate the customer’s requirements in
terms of information transport performance and network availability into network conﬁguration, space segment requirements,
back-up hardware elements and channel conﬁgurations.
Most of the customer’s requirements have been discussed in
Chapter 3, section 3.3. It has been mentioned how important it is to
start with reliable information on trafﬁc characteristics and to get
a clear perspective of the user’s performance goals in terms of link
availability, response time, etc.
Fortunately, most often VSAT networks replace existing leased
line data networks, so that the designer can start with a comprehensive network diagram and user locations. He also needs to know the
detailed characteristics of the host processing system: type, communications hardware interface, number of circuits, access protocols
and applications software.
Trafﬁc data are more difﬁcult to obtain. Ideally, what is needed
is, by type of application and by user location: the number of busy
hour transactions, the average size of transaction in and out, the
time of day for ﬁle transfer and for interactive trafﬁc, etc.
The customer will be asked to specify his performance objectives: average and percentile (for example 95%) delay for interactive
applications, and, for some applications, special requirements such
as delay jitter. His requirements on availability will determine radio
frequency link margins and terrestrial back-up connections. They
will also determine back-up hardware, maintenance policy and
back-up services such as shared or portable hub, portable VSATs
and alternative remote network management systems.
From these inputs, the designer will deﬁne the entire hardware
conﬁguration at the hub and at remote VSATs with respect to the
number of ports, bit rate, protocols and other parameters. The design
should make due allowance for possible expansion during the years
following the initial installation and operation.
The satellite space segment will be deﬁned in detail. The following
information should be included: type of carriers and transmitted
bit rate per carrier, number of inbound carriers per outbound
(TDM) carrier, total number of inbound and outbound carriers,
multiple access control with respect to contention, reservation or a
combination thereof.
The network design is then used to determine the cost of the
network, with possible feedback to the customer’s requirements.

NETWORKING ASPECTS

Guidelines for preliminary dimensioning

The design of a network can be supported by guidelines as an
outcome from simulations performed on a prevalent network
architecture [ZEI91a]. An example is now presented which deals
with the typical star network shown in Figure 4.40, for interactive
enquiry–response applications (see Table 1.2).
Every VSAT has a number of cluster control units (CCUs) connected to it via local or intermediate range terrestrial links (access
lines). The bit rate on these access lines is referred to as Rcv . Every
CCU, in turn, has a number of computer terminals (or display terminals) attached to it. The host computer is connected to the hub
station via a front end processor (FEP).
Due to the low volume and bursty nature of VSAT inquiry trafﬁc,
the inbound transponder access protocol is slotted ALOHA. The
outbound link operates in a TDM (time division multiplex) mode.
The bit rates of the inbound and outbound links are referred to as
Rvh and Rhv respectively. The hub station is connected to the FEP
through a high capacity terrestrial link. The bit rate of this link is
referred to as Rhf .
Polling emulation, as described in section 4.5.3, is used in the
two terrestrial links. The data link control over the satellite link is
kept simple by assuming that every enquiry message represents
an independent packet over the inbound link. Error-free links are
assumed, and retransmissions take place due to collisions in the

random access. When collisions occur, the packets are scheduled to
be retransmitted after a random delay chosen from a uniform distribution. Positive acknowledgement of successful enquiry messages
is required since VSATs cannot reliably receive their own transmissions. This implies a minimum time-out delay of approximately 0.5
to 0.6 s before a retransmission can be initiated. A ﬂow control process is also required in the inbound channel to prevent congestion or
deadlock situations. This is achieved by a sliding window technique
with a window size of seven messages.
The enquiry message length is 20 bytes and the response message
length is 256 bytes. However, since the messages are transacted by
a data link control layer, there is additional overhead associated
with transmission of every message. Further, one considers a single
response for every inputted enquiry. The generation of enquiry
messages at the CCUs is approximated by Poisson processes.
The network dimensioning refers to the process of determining
the minimum bit rate required for Rcv , Rvh , Rhf and Rhv , given
the network conﬁguration and the average response time required.
The network conﬁguration includes the number of VSATs (N), the
number of CCUs per VSAT (M), and the average message generation
rate at every CCU (λ msgh−1 ).
The CCU–VSAT and the hub–FEP links can each be viewed as
a bus conveying enquiry and response messages altogether. The
length of the enquiry message is 26 bytes (20 data bytes and 6 bytes
for addressing) and the length of the response message is 256 bytes.
The offered trafﬁc on these links is:
CCU–VSAT link:
hub–FEP link:

(26 + 256) × 8
3600
(26 + 256) × 8
Thf (bs−1 ) = MλN
3600

Tcv (bs−1 ) = Mλ

(4.32)
(4.33)

The VSAT–hub enbound link conveys enquiry messages only,
with a length equal to 32 bytes (26 as delivered by the CCU and
6 bytes for addressing). The hub–VSAT outbound link conveys
response messages only, with a length equal to 262 bytes (256 data
bytes and 6 bytes for addressing). The offered trafﬁc on each of these
links is:
32 × 8

(4.35)

The bit rate of every link will now be normalised to the offered
trafﬁc of this link. The network is ﬁrst dimensioned for a given

166

NETWORKING ASPECTS

trafﬁc conﬁguration. The resulting dimensioning parameters are
then used for other trafﬁc conﬁgurations. This allows the determination of the limits of validity of the parameters and derivation of
dimensioning guidelines.
It is considered that an acceptable response time should be of the
order of 2 to 3 seconds. In the following, the dimensioning procedure
will be demonstrated considering a speciﬁed mean response time of
2.5 seconds. Of course, the procedure is valid for other values of the
mean response time.
Figure 4.41 displays the effect of the bit rate of any link on the
mean delay. These results are obtained by simulation.
Curve 1 illustrates the inﬂuence of the CCU–VSAT link bit rate,
Rcv , on the network response time. All other links are overdimensioned to reduce their inﬂuence. This curve shows that the
CCU–VSAT link bit rate has a strong inﬂuence on the overall
response time. Note that for Rcv = 4800 bits−1 ≈ 2Tcv (normalised
bit rate = 2), the overall average delay is less than 2 seconds, and it
is needless to exceed that normalised bit rate.
Curve 2 illustrates the effect of the VSAT–hub link bit rate, Rvh , on
the network response time, setting Rcv = 4800 bits−1 ≈ 2Tcv , and for

overdimensioned hub–FEP and hub–VSAT links. It can be noted
that when the inbound link bit rate exceeds 4 times the offered
trafﬁc in this link (Rvh = 46 kbs−1 ≈ 4Tvh ), the effect of the bit rate of
this channel on the global average network response time becomes
negligible. One of the reasons for this good behaviour of the inbound
link operated in slotted–ALOHA is that small ﬁxed length messages
are considered for the enquiry trafﬁc. If variable length and/or long
enquiry messages were considered, the inbound link would have
more effect on the global average network response time.
Curve 3 illustrates the effect of the hub–FEP link bit rate, Rhf , on the
network response time. This curve is obtained for Rcv = 4800 bs−1 ≈
2Tcv and for Rvh = 46 kbs−1 ≈ 4Tvh . The hub–VSAT link is kept
overdimensioned. The curve shows that when the capacity of the
hub–FEP link exceeds 1.3 times the offered trafﬁc in this link, the link
has no more inﬂuence on the delay. From the selection of the above
values, this link can be dimensioned with Rhf = 130 kbs−1 ≈ 1.3Thf .
Curve 4 illustrates the effect of the hub–VSAT link bit rate,
Rhv , on the network response time. This curve is obtained for a
hub–FEP link bit rate of 130 kbs−1 ≈ 1.3Thf . The bit rates of the
CCU–VSAT link and the VSAT–hub link are the same as for curve
3. The curve indicates that the hub–VSAT link displays a very
small effect on the network response time. Hence, the bit rate of the
outbound link can be dimensioned to be equal to the offered trafﬁc
Thv (Rhv = Thv = 93 kbs−1 ).
(1) Effect of Rcv (Rvh = 200, Rhf = 300, Rhv = 300 kbs−1 );

(4) Effect of Rhv (Rcv = 4.8, Rvh = 46, Rhf = 130 kbs−1 )
In conclusion, the normalised bit rates required in the four links
are:
2 in the CCU–VSAT link,
4 in the VSAT–hub link,
1.3 in the hub–FEP link,
1 in the hub–VSAT link.
The resulting mean response time with this dimensioning is 2.16 s,
which fulﬁls the 2.5 s objective. If a smaller delay is desired, only
the bit rate of the CCU–VSAT link needs to be increased, since
increasing the bit rates of the other links does not really improve the
overall delay.

168

NETWORKING ASPECTS

The above dimensioning procedure is only intended to provide
good approximations of the required bit rates. Giving the exact
values is of little interest as, in practice, one has to use standardised bit rates (4.8, 9.6, 19.2, 56, 64 kbs−1 etc). For example, if the
above dimensioning procedure leads to a required bit rate in the
CCU–VSAT link of 6 kbs−1 , the actual value to be implemented
is the next higher standard bit rate which is 9.6 kbs−1 . Therefore,
the actual response time should be smaller than the response time
obtained by simulation.
The sensitivity of this dimensioning has been explored and is
reported in the reference article [ZEI91a]. Different CCU loads and
numbers of VSATs have been considered. It has been shown that, to
avoid too large a delay for a practical range of parameter variations,
one is led to consider a minimum network dimension, that is, Rcv =
4800 bits−1 , Rvh = 19.2 kbs−1 , Rhf = 56 kbs−1 , and Rhv = 56 kbs−1 .
In conclusion, given any network conﬁguration (M, N, λ) and a
delay requirement of 2.5 seconds, the network is dimensioned as
follows:
1. Compute the offered trafﬁc in each link Tcv , Tvh , Thf , Thv according
to formulas (4.32) to (4.35).
2. Compute the preliminary bit rate required in each link: Rcv =
2Tcv , Rvh = 4Tvh , Rhf = 1.3Thf , and Rhv = Thv .
3. Select, for each bit rate, the next higher standard bit rate.
4. If any of the resulting bit rates is smaller than the minimum
bit rate (i.e. Rcv < 4800 bs−1 , Rvh < 19.2 kbs−1 , Rhf < 56 kbs−1 , or
Rhv < 56 kbs−1 ), select the minimum bit rate.

4.7.3

Example

This procedure will now be applied to an example.
Consider a network characterised by N = 50 VSATs, M = 6
CCU/VSAT, and CCU load λ = 500 msgh−1 CCU−1 . This trafﬁc
conﬁguration results in the following offered trafﬁc in the four network links: Tcv = 1880 bs−1 , Tvh = 10.7 kbs−1 , Thf = 94 kbs−1 , and
Thv = 87.4 kbs−1 . Using the dimensioning guidelines of the last
section, we have:
1. The bit rate of the CCU–VSAT link Rcv should be twice Tcv (Rcv =
3760 bs−1 ). However, this value is smaller than the minimum bit
rate considered for this link which is 4800 bs−1 . Hence, select for
this link in the network a bit rate of 4800 bs−1 .

NETWORKING ASPECTS

2. The bit rate of the inbound channel Rvh should be at least four
times the offered trafﬁc Tvh in this link. The required bit rate is
then equal to 42.8 kbs−1 . Hence, select a bit rate of 56 kbs−1 which
is the next higher standard bit rate.
3. The bit rate of the hub–FEP link should be 1.3 times Thf . This gives
Rhf = 122.2 kbs−1 . The next higher standard bit rate is 128 kbs−1 .
4. In the hub–VSAT link, the required bit rate is equal to the offered
trafﬁc Thv (87.4 kbs−1 ). Use the next higher standard bit rate,
i.e. 128 kbs−1 .
Running the simulation with these values gives an average
response time of 1.9 s, which fulﬁls the requirement of an average
response time less than 2.5 s.

CONCLUSION

This chapter has described the organisation of a VSAT network,
both its physical conﬁguration and its protocol conﬁguration.
It has been shown that protocols that perform well on terrestrial
networks may cause poor channel efﬁciency when used on satellite
links, as a consequence of higher delay. Therefore, it is important to
perform protocol conversion at the interface between the hub station
and the host computer or the remote terminals and the VSATs.
A critical aspect for achieving good throughput is the error recovery technique which must be compatible with the satellite channel
delay and error characteristics. Error recovery may be carried out
at the link level where the VSATs and the hub station assume the
retransmission. An alternative is to recover errors at the transport
level where retransmission of packets in error is performed by the
remote terminals or the host computer.
Implementation of link level error recovery requires large transmitting and receiving buffers at VSATs and a hub that can handle
the number of packets equivalent to at least one round trip time.
Doing it at the transport level avoids such buffers but introduces
additional packet delay, as the time-out interval is longer.
It has been shown that the inherent delay (0.25 s for one hop) and
the typical bit error rate encountered on satellite links (10−6 –10−7
for 99.9% of time) are no severe impediment to providing the user
terminal with an acceptable service quality.
One must be aware of how important it is to select a multiple
access protocol according to the user application. For stream trafﬁc, demand assignment FDMA or TDMA is a good choice. FDMA

170

NETWORKING ASPECTS

systems, especially SCPC systems, allow operation at a low transmission rate, hence they have low transmission power requirements.
This favours low VSAT equipment cost. Unfortunately, multicarrier
operation of the satellite transponder leads to unavoidable generation of intermodulation products, as will be discussed in the next
chapter, unless operating the transponder at reduced power. But
this may offset the advantage gained from FDMA. TDMA systems
are known to exhibit the best efﬁciency and the highest ﬂexibility,
but at the expense of a high transmission rate. The best choice lies in
between, combining FDMA and TDMA: for instance, VSATs can be
organised in groups operating at different frequencies, with VSATs
in a group sharing a given frequency band and accessing the satellite
transponder in TDMA (Figure 4.22).
For bursty trafﬁc, it has been shown that a combination of random
TDMA and reservation techniques allows one to cope with a high
range of burstiness. For instance, a combined scheme of S-ALOHA
for transport of small data packets (high burstiness) and slot reservation for transport of long messages (low burstiness) gives today’s
VSAT networks the required ﬂexibility for supporting a mix of both
interactive and batch applications to the best user satisfaction.
Today, CDMA has not yet found widespread distribution in the
non-military world, apart from some low data rate applications,
to meet interference restrictions, and for applications that require
spectrum spreading for frequency coordination (for instance C-band
VSAT networks).

5
Radio frequency
link analysis
The previous chapter addressed the networking techniques which
allow connection set-up and reliable transfer of information from
one user terminal to another. This chapter will address information
transfer at the physical level.
Figure 5.1 reproduces an excerpt from Figure 4.6 in order to put
into perspective the respective topics of Chapter 4 and the present
one. Chapter 4 dealt with the peer layers of the hub and VSAT
interface within the VSAT network at data link control and satellite
channel access control levels. The present chapter focuses on the
physical layer, which involves coding for forward error correction
(FEC) and modulation.
Indeed, the satellite channel conveys information by means of
modulated radio frequency carriers which are relayed by the satellite transponder and then received by the destination station. Noise
contaminates the received carriers. Therefore, the retrieved baseband signals are also contaminated: analogue signals are noisy and
data may contain erroneous bits.
Basically, it is not feasible to provide error-free transmission at
the physical layer level. The only hope is to limit the bit error rate
(BER) to an acceptable level constrained by cost considerations. It
is the job of the upper layers, and especially the data link layer, to
ensure error-free transmission by means of automatic repeat request
protocols. The job is easier when the physical layer already provides
‘clean’ information, thanks to a low enough bit error rate. As the BER
decreases, the performance of the channel improves, as illustrated
in Figure 4.8.

This chapter aims to provide the means to calculate the quality
of the information content delivered to the data link control layer.
The quality of digital information is measured by the bit error rate,
which is the ratio of the number of bits received in error to the
total number of received bits. The bit error rate depends on the
type of modulation and coding performed, and on the carrier to
noise power spectral density ratio at the input of the receiver. This
ratio, C/N0 , can be considered as a quality measure of the radio
frequency link.

5.1

PRINCIPLES

The link analysis will be performed in the context of a star shaped
network, as illustrated in Figure 5.2. The transmitting VSATs located

within the coverage of the receiving antenna of the satellite generate N inbound carriers. These carriers are relayed by the satellite
transponder to the hub station. The hub station communicates with
the VSATs by means of a single outbound carrier which is modulated by a time division multiplexed (TDM) stream of bits received
by all VSATs within the coverage of the transmitting antenna of the
satellite, thanks to the broadcasting capability of the satellite within
its coverage area.
A carrier originating from a transmitting station and received
by the satellite transponder at the uplink frequency, is ampliﬁed
by the satellite transponder and frequency translated before being
transmitted and received by the earth stations tuned to the downlink
frequency. This carrier is corrupted by noise with different origins
as discussed below.

5.1.1

Thermal noise

Thermal noise is present on the uplink and the downlink and is
produced by natural sources. First, we have the radiation produced

174

RADIO FREQUENCY LINK ANALYSIS

by radiating bodies and captured by the receiving antennas. With
satellite communications, the principal sources of radiation are the
earth for the satellite antenna, and the sky for the earth station
antenna. Such noise is called ‘antenna noise’. Another source of
thermal noise is the noise generated by the receiver components.

5.1.2

Interference noise

Some interference is to be expected from systems sharing the same
frequency bands, either satellite-based systems or terrestrial ones.
Interference is introduced on the uplink, where the receiving satellite antenna is illuminated by carriers transmitted by earth stations
belonging to an adjacent geostationary satellite system, or by terrestrial microwave relays. Interference is also introduced on the
downlink where the receiving earth station antenna captures carriers transmitted by adjacent satellites or terrestrial microwave relays.
This interference acts as noise if the undesired carrier spectrum
overlaps with that of the wanted carrier. The problem may be of
special importance on the downlink as the small size of the VSAT
station and its resulting large beamwidth makes it more sensitive to
reception of off-axis carriers. This is why it is preferable that VSAT
networks operate within exclusive bands (see section 1.6.4).
The above interference is generated by transmitters others than
those operating within the considered VSAT network. Interference is also generated within the considered VSAT network. This
is sometimes called ‘self-interference’. For example, some VSAT
networks incorporate earth stations operating on two orthogonal
polarisations at the same frequency. It may also be that the satellite is a multibeam satellite, with stations transmitting on the same
polarisation and frequency but in different beams. These techniques
are referred to as ‘frequency reuse’ techniques and are used to
increase the capacity of satellite systems without consuming more
bandwidth [MAR02 pp 334–336]. However, the drawback is an
increased level of interference due to imperfect cross polarisation
isolation of antennas in the case of frequency reuse by orthogonal
polarisation, and imperfect beam to beam isolation in the case of
spatial frequency reuse.

5.1.3

Intermodulation noise

From Figure 5.2, one can see that the satellite transponder supports
several carriers, either N if the inbound carriers and the outbound

RADIO FREQUENCY LINK ANALYSIS

175

ones are fed to separate transponders, or N + 1 if they share the same
transponder, which is usually the case. With an access scheme like
TDMA, where carriers are transmitted sequentially within a frame
period (see Figure 4.20), only one of these carriers is ampliﬁed at
a given instant by the transponder. However, with access schemes
such as FDMA (see Figures 4.16 to 4.19) or CDMA (see Figure 4.23),
where carriers are continuously transmitted by the earth stations,
the transponder ampliﬁes several carriers simultaneously in a socalled ‘multicarrier mode’. It is also the case when a hybrid access
mode such as FDMA/TDMA is implemented (see Figure 4.22). The
difference resides in the number of simultaneous carriers. This has
two consequences: ﬁrst, the output power of the satellite transponder
is shared between the simultaneous carriers and this reduces by as
many the power available to each carrier, secondly the presence
of simultaneous carriers in the non-linear amplifying device of the
transponder causes the generation of intermodulation products in
the form of signals at frequencies fIM , which are linear combinations
of the P input frequencies [MAR02, p 286]. Thus:
fIM = m1 f1 + m2 f2 + · · · + mP fP

(Hz)

(5.1)

where m1 , m2 , . . . , mP are positive or negative integers. The quantity
X, called the order of an intermodulation product is deﬁned as:
X = |m1 | + |m2 | + · · · + |mP |

(5.2)

As the centre frequency of the pass-band transponder is large compared with its 
bandwidth, only those odd-order intermodulation
products with
mi = 1 fall within the channel bandwidth. Moreover, the power of the intermodulation products decreases with the
order of the product. Thus, in practice, only third-order products
and, to a lesser extent, ﬁfth order products are signiﬁcant. Intermodulation products are transmitted on the downlink along with
the wanted carrier, but no useful information can be extracted from
them. They act as noise, as a fraction of the overall intermodulation
product power falls into the bandwidth of the earth station receiver
tuned to the wanted carrier. They can be modelled as white noise,
with constant power spectral density N0IM given by:
N0IM =

NIM
BN

(WHz−1 )

(5.3)

where NIM is the intermodulation power measured at the transponder output within the noise bandwidth BN of the earth station
receiver.

Figure 5.3 illustrates the above discussion and shows how intermodulation products can be accounted for in the form of an
equivalent white noise with power spectral density equal to (N0 )IM .

5.1.4

Carrier power to noise power spectral
density ratio

The noise contributions are to be considered in relationship to the
wanted carrier they corrupt. Therefore, one should specify carrier
power to noise power spectral density ratios at the point in the link
where noise corrupts the carrier.
Figure 5.4 indicates at which point in the link a given quantity
is relevant, and Table 5.1 speciﬁes notations and deﬁnitions for the
corresponding carrier power to noise power spectral density ratio.
In both Figure 5.4 and Table 5.1 GXpond is the power gain of the
transponder for carrier power CU at the transponder input.

(C/N0 )IM = GXpond CU /N0IM

N0T of the corrupting noise is that of the total noise contribution.
This total contribution builds up from:
– the uplink thermal noise and uplink interference noise retransmitted on the downlink by the satellite transponder. On their
way from the satellite transponder input to the earth station
receiver input, they are subject to power gains and losses which
amount to a total gain GTE . This power gain is the product of the
transponder power gain GXpond and the gain GD from transponder output to earth station receiver input (which in practice is
much less than one in absolute value, so it should actually be
considered as a loss):
GTE = GXpond × GD

(5.4)

Therefore, the respective contributions of uplink thermal noise
and uplink interference noise at the earth station receiver input
are GTE N0U and GTE N0iU . Note that GXpond has been deﬁned as
the transponder power gain for carrier power CU at transponder
input. The transponder being non-linear, the actual transponder
gain depends on the power of the considered input signal. Hence,
GXpond has different values for the noise and for the carrier. This
is referred to as the ‘capture effect’. However, for simplicity, this
will not be considered here;
– the intermodulation noise generated at the transponder output
and transmitted on the downlink. Hence, its contribution at the
earth station receiver input is GD N0IM ;
– the downlink thermal noise and downlink interference with
respective contributions at the earth station receiver input N0D
and N0iD .
The total noise power spectral density at the earth station receiver
input is given by:

N0j (WHz−1 )
(5.5)
N0T =

178

where N0j are the above individual contributions at the earth station

The carrier power to noise power spectral density ratio at the earth
station receiver input CD /N0T conditions the quality of the baseband
signal delivered to the user terminal in terms of BER. This ratio
relates to the overall link from station to station and will be noted
(C/N0 )T (T for total). (C/N0 )T can be calculated as follows:

Note that introducing the actual transponder gain depending on

for the noise and for the carrier would introduce a corrective term
to the values of (C/N0 )U and (C/N0i )U in the above equation.
The following sections provide means for the determination
of the terms implied in the calculation of (C/N0 )T according to
equation (5.7). Sections 5.2 and 5.3 discuss the parameters involved

involved in the calculation of (C/N0 )IM . Section 5.5 is dedicated to

for the overall link (C/N0 )T . Section 5.7 deals with bit error rate
determination. Section 5.8 demonstrates how power and bandwidth
can be exchanged through the use of forward error correction.
Section 5.9 gives an example of a calculation for VSAT networks.

UPLINK ANALYSIS

Figure 5.5 illustrates the geometry of the uplink. In order to calculate
the value of (C/N0 )U in the worst case, the transmitting earth station
is assumed to be located at the edge of the uplink coverage, deﬁned
as the contour where the satellite receiving antenna has a constant
gain deﬁned relative to its maximum value at boresight, for instance
−3 dB, corresponding to a reduction by a factor two of the gain
compared to its maximum. From Table 5.1, the ratio (C/N0 )U is
deﬁned as:

Power flux density at satellite distance

The power ﬂux density Φ is deﬁned in Appendix 5. Assume the
satellite to be at distance R from a transmitting earth station, with
effective isotropic radiated power EIRPES . Then the power ﬂux
density at satellite level is:
Φ=

EIRPES

Satellite transponder input characteristics are given in terms of
saturated power ﬂux density Φsat , which designates the power
ﬂux density required to saturate the transponder. From expression (5.13), it can be seen that Φ is controlled by the transmitting
earth station EIRPES . Should the transmitting earth station EIRPES
be allocated to a single carrier, the power of that carrier at the
transponder input determines IBO or IBO1 , as deﬁned in Appendix
6 by equations (A6.2) and (A6.5) respectively. For example:
IBO1 =

Φ1
Φsat

(5.15)

IBO1 (dB) = Φ1 (dBWm−2 ) − Φsat (dBWm−2 )
Should N stations be transmitting simultaneously, the powers of
their individual carriers combine at the transponder input, and the
total ﬂux density is given by the sum of their individual contributions, each calculated from (5.13) or (5.14):

Φt =

IBOt (dB) = Φt (dBWm−2 ) − Φsat (dBWm−2 )

5.2.2

Effective isotropic radiated power of the
earth station

From the deﬁnition given in Appendix 5, the effective isotropic
radiated power of the earth station EIRPES is expressed as:
EIRPES = PT GT

(W)

(5.17)

EIRPES (dBW) = PT (dBW) + GT (dBi)
where PT is the power fed to the transmitting antenna, and GT is the
earth station antenna transmit gain in the pertinent direction.
Figure 5.6 is an enlargement of the transmitting earth station
represented in Figure 5.5. The earth station transmitter TX with
output power PTX feeds power PT to the antenna through a feeder
with feeder loss LFTX . The antenna displays a transmit gain GTmax
at boresight, and a reduced transmit gain GT in the direction of
the satellite as a result of the transmit depointing off-axis angle θT .

The transmitter output power PTX is smaller than or equal to the

In order to calculate the actual gain GT , one needs to know more
about the antenna gain pattern. Appendix 4 deﬁnes the antenna
gain pattern and its most important parameters, the maximum gain
Gmax and the half power beamwidth θ3dB , which are expressed as:

where:

Figures 5.7 and 5.8 display values of these parameters for typical
hub and VSAT antenna diameters. For the transmit gain and half
power beamwidth values, one should consider 14 GHz and 6 GHz
for the frequency values.
Should there be no feeder loss, the power fed to the antenna would
be PTX , and should the antenna be perfectly pointed, its transmit gain
in the direction of the satellite would be equal to GTmax . Therefore,
EIRPES would be maximum and equal to:
EIRPESmax = PTX GTmax

θ3dB
where θ3dB is given by (5.19).
The depointing angle θT is not easy to determine. Should the earth
station be equipped with a tracking antenna, as would a large hub
station, say with antenna diameter larger than 5 m at Ku-band and
9 m at C-band, the depointing angle is given by the tracking accuracy

186

RADIO FREQUENCY LINK ANALYSIS

of the tracking equipment, and is typically of the order of 0.2θ3dB .
Therefore, the depointing loss remains smaller than 0.5 dB. But small
hub stations and VSATs are equipped with ﬁxed mount antennas.
The value of the maximum depointing angle θTmax then depends
on the pointing accuracy at installation, and the subsequent motion
of the geostationary satellite. An upper limit to the depointing angle
value can be estimated from an analysis of the pointing procedure
and the satellite motion.
Figure 5.10 represents the underlying geometry. The ﬁgure displays off-axis angles as viewed from the antenna boresight, represented by the centre of the circle. As indicated in Chapter 3,
section 3.2.3, at time of installation the antenna is pointed towards
the satellite by a search for a maximum received power from a
satellite beacon or a downlink carrier. Once this is done the antenna
is left to itself, and one assumes that the mount is robust enough
to ensure a constant pointing direction with time. The radius of
the circle in Figure 5.10 represents the maximum initial pointing
error (IPE). Now the satellite is maintained within a so-called station keeping window (see Chapter 2, section 2.3.8). It is assumed
here that the station keeping window dimensions are equal in the
north–south (NS) and in the east–west (EW) directions, so that
the station keeping window can be represented by the square in
Figure 5.10 with half-width SKW. The worst situation occurs when
the initial pointing is performed while the satellite is at an extreme
position within its station keeping window, say the ES corner, and
the actual direction of the antenna boresight coincides with the
centre of the initial pointing error circle as positioned on the ﬁgure.
Subsequently, the satellite may move to the opposite extreme position, say the NW corner. Therefore, the maximum depointing angle

θTmax is the sum of the initial depointing error IPE and the angle
corresponding to the extreme positions of the satellite, that is the
diagonal of the station keeping window.
θTmax = IPE + 2(2)1/2 SKW (degrees)

(5.25)

The initial pointing error IPE is typically equal to 0.2θ3dB, where
θ3dB represents the half power beamwidth of the antenna at the
frequency of the received beacon or carrier used for pointing, i.e. at
downlink frequency. Denoting this frequency by fD , and combining

Uplink path loss

The uplink path loss, LU , is the overall attenuation of the carrier
power on its way from the earth station transmitting antenna to the
satellite receiving antenna. It can be shown that this attenuation has
two components, the free space loss, LFS , deﬁned in Appendix 5,
and the atmospheric loss, LA , so that the path loss can be expressed
as [MAR02, Chapter 5]:

RADIO FREQUENCY LINK ANALYSIS

LU = LFS LA

189

(5.27)

LU (dB) = LFS (dB) + LA (dB)
The free space loss depends on the frequency f and on the distance
R between the earth station and the satellite:

R0
where c is the speed of light (c = 3 × 108 ms−1 ) and R0 is the satellite
height (R0 = 35 786 km for a geostationary satellite).
The ratio (R/R0 )2 is a geometric factor which takes into account
the position of the earth station relative to the subsatellite point on
the earth surface, and is expressed as (see section 2.3.3):
 2
R
= 1 + 0.42(1 − cos l cos L)
(5.29)
R0
where l and L are respectively the difference in latitude and in
longitude between the earth station and the subsatellite point.
Notice that the subsatellite point of a geostationary satellite is
on the Equator, and hence its latitude is zero, so l identiﬁes with
the earth station latitude, while L should be taken as the actual
difference in longitude between that of the earth station and that of
the satellite meridian.
For a geostationary satellite, Figure 5.13 gives the variation in
dB of the ﬁrst term of equation (5.28) as a function of frequency,
and Figure 5.14 gives the variation in dB of the second term of
equation (5.28) as a function of the earth station location. The free
space loss LFS (in dB) is calculated by adding the values obtained
from these two ﬁgures. The second term appears to be a small
corrective term to the ﬁrst one.
The attenuation of radio frequency carriers in the atmosphere,
denoted by LA , is due to the presence of gaseous components in the
troposphere, water (rain, clouds, snow and ice) and the ionosphere.
Water plays an important role, especially at Ka-band, as it has an
absorption line at 22.3 GHz. Gaseous components and water in the
form of vapour are constantly present in the atmosphere. Water
is occasionally present in the form of rain and as such produces
attenuation and cross polarisation of the radio wave, i.e. transfer of
part of the energy transmitted in one polarisation to the orthogonal
polarisation state.

Figure 5.14 Variation in dB of (R /R0 )2 as a function of the position of the
earth station with respect to the subsatellite point for a geostationary satellite

where AAG is the always present attenuation due to the atmosphere
during ‘clear sky’ conditions (no rain) and ARAIN is the additional
and occasional attenuation due to rain.
The attenuation AAG depends on frequency and elevation angle,
and is higher at low elevation angles as a result of the increased
path length of the radio wave in the atmosphere. One can consider
that the attenuation AAG is, for elevation angles greater than 10◦ ,
negligible at C-band, less than 0.5 dB at Ku-band, and less than 1 dB
at Ka-band.
The attenuation ARAIN is to be considered in relationship to rainfall
rate, also called rain intensity, expressed in mmhour−1 , elevation
angle and frequency. Relevant techniques for the determination of
rain attenuation ARAIN for various time percentages are presented
in [MAR02 pp 224–236]. ARAIN increases with rainfall rate and can
reach high values when small percentages of time are considered.
Rainfall rate depends on the climate and hence on the considered
location. The percentage of time a given value of rain attenuation
ARAIN is exceeded can be calculated from the rainfall rate, R0.01 ,
expressed in mmhr−1 , exceeded at the considered location for 0.01%
of an average year. Figure 5.15 shows a world map with contours
of constant value for R0.01 . These are simpliﬁed contours, just to
show typical trends and underline the fact that the equatorial zones
are faced with rainfall rate values higher than temperate climate
zones (near the equator R0.01 is of the order of 100 mmhr−1 , and less
than 50 mmhr−1 at latitudes higher than 45◦ ). More accurate data
and maps in digital formats can be obtained from the International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), and can be viewed in [MAR02
pp 225–230]. ARAIN also depends on the length of the path of the
radio frequency wave through the atmosphere, and therefore on

Percentage of time attenuation is exceeded
(%)

the elevation angle of the antenna, which depends on the relative
positioning of the earth station with respect to the satellite. For earth
stations far away from the satellite, and therefore pointing at low elevation angle, the path through rain is longer, and the attenuation is
higher. Finally, ARAIN increases with frequency from C-band to Kaband. Vertical polarisation is more attenuated by rain than horizontal polarisation as a result of the non-spherical shape of raindrops.
Figures 5.16 and 5.17 display the percentage of time the value
of rain attenuation indicated on the horizontal axis is exceeded
for different frequencies of a vertically polarised wave, considering
elevation angle E = 35◦ . Figure 5.16 relates to R0.01 = 30 mmhr−1 and
therefore is representative of temperate climate zones. Figure 5.17
relates to R0.01 = 100 mmhr−1 , and therefore is representative of
tropical or equatorial climate zones.
Attenuation due to rain clouds and fog is usually small compared
with that due to rain precipitation, except for clouds and fog with
a high water concentration. For an elevation angle E = 20◦ , it is
negligible at C-band, typically 0.5 to 1.5 dB at Ku-band, and 2 to
4 dB at Ka-band. This attenuation, however, is observed for a greater
time percentage. Attenuation due to ice clouds is smaller still. Dry
snow has little effect. Although wet snowfalls can cause greater
attenuation than the equivalent rainfall rate, this situation is very
rare and has little effect on attenuation statistics. The degradation of
antenna characteristics due to accumulation of snow and ice on the
dish may be more signiﬁcant than the effect of snow along the path.

Another effect of rain is depolarisation of the wave. As a consequence, where frequency reuse by orthogonal polarisation is
used, a part of the carrier power transmitted in one polarisation
is transferred to the orthogonal polarisation, causing cross polarisation interference. This is discussed in section 5.5 in relation to
interference.

Figure of merit of satellite
receiving equipment

The ﬁgure of merit (G/T)SL of the satellite receiving equipment
incorporates the composite gain from the antenna to the satellite
receiver input, and the uplink system noise temperature. As a
factor in the expression (5.10) or (5.11) for (C/N0 )U , it indicates the
capability of the satellite receiving equipment to build up a high
value of (C/N0 )U . Its expression is given by:

where GRmax is the satellite antenna receive gain at boresight and LR is
the off-axis gain loss corresponding to reception from a station at the
edge of coverage. If the considered coverage contour corresponds to
that of the half-power beamwidth, then LR = 2 and LR (dB) = 3 dB.
Lpol is the gain loss as a result of possible polarisation mismatch
between the antenna and the received wave. Methods for evaluating
this loss are given in [MAR02, p 205 and p 391]. A practical value is
Lpol = 0.1 dB. LFRX is the feeder loss from the antenna to the receiver
input, typically 1 dB. TU is the uplink system noise temperature,
and is given by:

where TA is the satellite antenna noise temperature, TF is the temperature of the feeder and TR is the satellite receiver effective input
noise temperature. Practical values are: TA = 290 K, TF = 290 K,
LFRX = 1 dB, TR = 500 K, hence TU = 790 K.
The maximum satellite antenna gain GRmax depends on the coverage and is typically 20 dBi for global coverage and 38 dBi for a narrow
spot beam coverage. Therefore, (G/T)SL ranges from −13 dBK−1 for
a global coverage to +5 dBK−1 for a spot beam coverage as indicated
in Table 2.2.

Figure 5.18 illustrates the geometry of the downlink. In order to
calculate the worst case value of (C/N0 )D , the transmitting earth
station is assumed to be located at the edge of the downlink coverage,
deﬁned as the contour where the satellite receiving antenna has a
constant gain deﬁned relative to its maximum value at boresight, for
instance −3 dB, corresponding to a reduction by a factor two of the
gain compared to its maximum. From Table 5.1, the ratio (C/N0 )D is
deﬁned as:

EIRPSLsat is the effective isotropic radiated power of the satellite (W)
when operated at saturation (see section 5.3.1). LD is the downlink
path loss (see section 5.3.3). (G/T)ES is the ﬁgure of merit of the
earth station (see section 5.3.4). k is the Boltzman constant: k =
1.3 × 10−23 JK−1 ; k (dBJK−1 ) = 10 log k = −228.6 dBJK−1 .
The above expressions assume that the satellite transmits a noisefree carrier so that the noise which corrupts the carrier at the

RADIO FREQUENCY LINK ANALYSIS

earth station receiver is downlink noise only, with neither contribution from the uplink noise relayed by the transponder, nor from
interference.

5.3.1

Effective isotropic radiated power
of the satellite

From the deﬁnition given in Appendix 5, the effective isotropic
radiated power of the satellite is expressed as:
EIRPSL = PT GT

(W)

(5.37)

EIRPSL (dBW) = PT (dBW) + GT (dBi)
where PT is the power fed to the transmitting antenna and GT is
the satellite antenna transmit gain along the constant gain coverage contour.
The power PT fed to the antenna depends on the power PTX at the
output of the transponder ampliﬁer and the feeder loss LFTX :
PTX
(W)
LFTX
PT (dBW) = PTX (dBW) − LFTX (dB)

(5.38)

EIRPSLsat is obtained when the transponder ampliﬁer operates at
saturation. The actual satellite EIRP depends on the total output
back-off:
EIRPSL = OBOt EIRPSLsat

(W)

(5.39)

EIRPSL (dBW) = OBOt (dB) + EIRPSLsat (dBW)
OBOt is a function of IBOt , as discussed in Appendix 6.
Table 2.2 gives typical values of satellite transponder EIRPSLsat
according to the type of coverage, assuming that the transmitted
carrier beneﬁts from the saturated transponder output power.

5.3.2

Power Flux density at earth surface

According to the deﬁnition given in Appendix 5, the power ﬂux
density generated by satellite transmission of a carrier at the earth
surface is equal to:
Φ=

EIRPSL
4π R2

(Wm−2 )

Φ(dBWm−2 ) = EIRPSL (dBW) − log 4π R2

(5.40)

198

RADIO FREQUENCY LINK ANALYSIS

Radio regulations impose limits on the power ﬂux density at the
earth surface produced by satellites; according to expression (5.40),
such limits translate into maximum values of EIRPSL . The objective
here is to limit the level of interference from an interfering satellite
onto an earth station in the wanted satellite network. This aspect is
discussed in more detail in section 5.5.

5.3.3

Downlink path loss

The downlink path loss LD is the overall attenuation of the carrier
power on its way from the satellite transmitting antenna to the earth
station receiving antenna. As for the uplink, it builds up from two
components, the free space loss, LFS , and the atmospheric loss, LA ,
so that the path loss can be expressed as:
LD = LFS LA

(5.41)

LD (dB) = LFS (dB) + LA (dB)
The downlink free space loss LFS depends on the downlink frequency f and on the distance R between the earth station and the
satellite, with an expression identical to (5.28) used for the uplink
free space loss. The distance R is taken into account by the same
geometric factor (R/R0 )2 as for the uplink, so expression (5.29) can
be used as well.
Values can be obtained from Figures 5.13 and 5.14, using the
appropriate downlink frequency, and relative coordinates of the
receiving earth station.
The atmospheric loss LA is again the result of the combined effect
of attenuation due to atmospheric gases AAG and attenuation due
to rain ARAIN . Values for AAG have been discussed in the context
of the uplink. Calculation of ARAIN can be performed according
to [MAR02, pp 224–236]. The curves in Figures 5.16 and 5.17 can
be considered for a preliminary evaluation of the value of ARAIN
exceeded for a given percentage of time depending on the climatic region

Figures 5.7 and 5.8, considering the actual value of the downlink frequency.
The determination of the maximum value θRmax of θR has been
discussed in section 5.2.2 and is illustrated in Figure 5.10. Actually,
θRmax is equal to θTmax as given by expression (5.25). Values of LRmax
(dB) are readily calculated from (5.24) by replacing θT by θR and
considering θR = θRmax .
Expression (5.43) shows that the downlink system noise temperature depends on the earth station antenna noise temperature TA . The
antenna noise temperature TA represents the overall contribution of
noise components captured by the antenna. Two situations are to be
considered:
– Antenna noise temperature for clear sky conditions (Figure 5.20).
The antenna captures the noise radiated by the sky with temperature TSKY and a contribution TGROUND from the ground in the
vicinity of the earth station. The overall contribution is given by:
TA = TSKY + TGROUND

In the above formula, all values of noise temperature and gain are
to be expressed in absolute value (not in dB). Usually, the LNA gain
is high enough (typically 50 dB = 105 ) for all terms but the ﬁrst one
to be negligible. Therefore: TR ≈ TLNA , with a typical value equal to
30 K at C-band and 80 K at Ku-band.
From the above set of expressions, one can see that the ﬁgure
of merit (G/T)ES of an earth station is maximal when there is no

INTERMODULATION ANALYSIS

When operated in a non-linear mode, the transponder ampliﬁer
generates intermodulation products, and the transponder output

206

RADIO FREQUENCY LINK ANALYSIS

power is shared not only between the ampliﬁed carriers but also
with the intermodulation products. This is most pronounced at and
near transponder saturation, when the total input back-off is equal
to, or approaches, zero (see Appendix 6 for deﬁnition of back-off).
Intermodulation products of modulated carriers are transmitted
along with the wanted carrier and act as noise for the wanted carrier
as received by the destination earth station.
Figure 5.25 gives typical curves for the carrier power to intermodulation noise power density ratio (C/N0 )IM at the destination earth
station receiver input, as a function of the transponder ampliﬁer
total input back-off, assuming n equally powered carriers.

INTERFERENCE ANALYSIS
Expressions for carrier-to-interference ratio

Interference is unwanted radio frequency energy introduced at the
end receiver of the wanted link. Figure 5.26 illustrates the spectrum
of a wanted carrier contaminated by an interfering carrier. The
receiver with equivalent noise bandwidth BN captures carrier power
C, and interference power Ni . The carrier-to-interference power ratio
is C/Ni .
The amount of interference power into the receiver depends on
the overlap of the carrier spectra, as illustrated in Figure 5.26.
The receiver noise bandwidth BN is matched to the bandwidth
occupied by the wanted carrier with power C. Power C is given by:
C = PSDw BN

(W)

(5.57)

where PSDw is the wanted carrier power spectral density (WHz−1 ).
The interfering carrier has a power spectral density PSDi (WHz−1 )
and occupies a band Bi . The amount of interfering power Ni captured
by the receiver is equal to the spectrum overlap area:
Ni = PSDi min(Bi , BN )

(W)

(5.58)

where min(Bi , BN ) represents the smallest of the two bandwidths, Bi
or BN .

LR is the off-axis gain loss,
Lpol is the gain loss corresponding to antenna
polarisation mismatch,
LFRX is the feeder loss from antenna to receiver input.
The above derivations are approximate as no account is made
of the actual shape of the modulated carrier spectrum. A more
realistic approach should also consider that the centre frequency of
the spectrum of the wanted carrier and the interfering carrier may
not be coincident.

5.5.2

Types of interference

Interference can be:
– self-interference, i.e. transmissions by the wanted satellite system
which hosts the considered VSAT network; or
– external interference, i.e. transmissions from systems sharing the
same frequency bands as the wanted satellite system. Candidate
interfering systems are other satellite systems and terrestrial
microwave systems. C-band and most of Ku-band are shared by
satellite and terrestrial microwave systems (see Figure 1.17). It
is therefore convenient to operate VSAT networks in bands that
are allocated to satellite links on a primary and exclusive basis,

RADIO FREQUENCY LINK ANALYSIS

209

as this eliminates the interference from terrestrial microwave
systems. However, this does not protect a VSAT network from
being interfered with by other satellite-based networks.

5.5.3

Self-interference

Self-interference is caused by frequency reuse and imperfect ﬁltering. The ﬁrst type is often called co-channel interference (CCI), the
second type adjacent channel interference (ACI).

5.5.3.1 Co-channel interference
Co-channel interference (CCI) is a drawback of frequency reuse
techniques which aim to increase the capacity of a satellite system
without demanding more frequency band. These techniques have
been presented in Chapter 2, section 2.1.5.
Co-channel interference originates in imperfect isolation between
geographically separated beams or between orthogonal polarisations reusing the same frequency band. Therefore, it strongly
depends on the antenna characteristics of the earth station and
the satellite.
Beam to beam interference
Figure 5.27 illustrates the generation of co-channel interference as a
result of imperfect isolation between beams in a multibeam satellite
system. The VSAT network is assumed to be located within beam 1.
An earth station belonging to some other network is located in beam
2. As a result of the non zero gain of the antenna gain pattern deﬁning
beam 1 in the direction of this earth station, some of its emitted power
(upward arrow in black) is received in beam 1 (upward arrow in
grey). This power enters the transponder conveying the inbound and
outbound links of the VSAT network. As frequency reuse implies
that both beams use the same frequency band, there is a chance
of carrier spectrum overlap between the carrier emitted by the
station of beam 2 and one or several of the VSAT network uplinked
carriers (bidirectional arrows in black representing inbound and
outbound links). This overlap constitutes uplink interference into
the VSAT network.
The transponder dedicated to beam 2 transmits carriers to stations
of beam 2. The downward arrow in black in beam 2 represents one
of these carriers. A part of its power is emitted in beam 1 (downward
arrows in grey in beam 1) and the part of its spectrum that overlaps

is at the edge of beam 1 and the interfering station at the edge
of beam 2, as near as possible to the wanted station, so that the
difference GRXw (dBi) − GRXi (dBi) is minimal. The difference value

where EIRPSL1ww is the satellite EIRP in beam 1 for the wanted
carrier in the direction of the wanted station. Its value depends
on the output back-off for that carrier, OBOw , and the satellite
EIRP in beam 1 at saturation in the direction of the wanted station,
EIRPSL1wsat :
EIRPSL1ww (dBW) = OBOw (dB) + EIRPSL1wsat (dBW)

(5.64)

EIRPSL2iw is the satellite EIRP in beam 2 for the interfering carrier
in the direction of the wanted station. Its value depends on the
output back-off for that carrier, OBOi , and the satellite EIRP in beam
2 at saturation, EIRPSL2wsat in the direction of the wanted station:
EIRPSL2iw (dBW) = OBOi (dB) + EIRPSL2wsat (dBW)

The worst case should consider that the wanted station is at the
edge of beam 1 and the interfering station at the edge of beam
2, as near as possible to the wanted station so that the difference
EIRPSL1ww (dBW) − EIRPSL2iw (dBW) is minimal.
If one assumes that beams 1 and 2 have equal saturated maximum
EIRP and identical gain pattern, then:

Should the interfering stations be part of the considered VSAT
network, then the VSAT network operation requires the use of
two transponders, one for each group of carriers with the same
polarisation. This is generally not justiﬁed for VSAT networks,
hence all VSATs and the hub within the geographical coverage
of the beam operate on the same polarisation. Cross polarisation
interference then originates in carriers transmitted by stations of
other networks using the same satellite system and operating within
the same frequency bands as the considered VSAT network but on
the orthogonal polarisation. These stations may be located within the
same beam, and their carriers are then conveyed by the cross-polar
satellite transponder, as illustrated in Figure 5.28.
The level of interference is conditioned by the cross polarisation
isolation (XPI) of earth station and satellite antennas. The cross
polarisation of an antenna is deﬁned in Appendix 4. Figure 5.29
illustrates how energy from one polarisation contaminates the

ends of a satellite link.
Carriers are transmitted at the same frequency, one on each X
and Y polarisation. Px and Py are the respective transmitted powers. Due to imperfect cross polarisation isolation, a contribution Qx
is transmitted along with Px . The receiving antenna receives the
wanted carrier Cx to which is added Ix , the interfering contribution from Qx . On the orthogonal polarisation, it receives Cy , and
due to imperfect cross polarisation isolation, a contribution Jx is
generated, which is added to Ix , so the total interference power is
Ix + Jx . A similar process occurs on the Y-component. Table 5.10
displays the different power components and the resulting carrier
to interference ratio.

However, it may be that the power transmitted by the interfering
station is much higher than the power of a transmitting VSAT.
Assume, for instance, that the interfering station transmits on the
Y polarisation with an EIRP 10 dB higher than that of a VSAT on
its inbound X-polarised link, then Py /Px = Cy /Cx = 10 and C/Ni
reduces to 14 dB. Similar considerations apply to the downlink.
The above calculations do not include depolarisation of the wave
on its way from the transmitter to the receiver, which occurs in
the atmosphere in the presence of rain, or ice clouds. Rain induced
depolarisation results from differential attenuation and differential
phase shift between two characteristic orthogonal polarisations.
These effects originate in the non-spherical shape of raindrops.
The relationship between cross polarised discrimination XPD (see
Appendix 4 for deﬁnition) and the co-polarised path attenuation
ARAIN is important for predictions based on attenuation statistics (as
in Figures 5.16 and 5.17).
The cross polarisation discrimination XPD (p) not exceeded for
p% of the time is given by:
XPD(p) = XPDrain − Cice

Expression (5.73) is in agreement with long term measurements
for 8 GHz ≤ f ≤ 35 GHz and elevation angle E ≤ 60◦ . For lower
frequencies down to 4 GHz, one can calculate XPD1 (p) at frequency
f1 (8 GHz ≤ f1 ≤ 30 GHz) according to expression (5.73) and derive
XPD2 (p) at frequency f2 (4 GHz ≤ f2 ≤ 8 GHz) from the following
semi-empirical formula:


f2 [1 − 0.484(1 + cos 4τ2 )]0.5
XPD2 (p) = XPD1 (p) − 20 log
f1 [1 − 0.484(1 + cos 4τ1 )]0.5
where τ1 and τ2 are the respective polarisation tilt angles at frequencies f1 and f2 .
Snow (dry or wet) causes similar phenomena. Ice clouds, where
high altitude ice crystals are in a region close to the 0◦ C isotherm,
also contribute to cross polarisation. However, in contrast to rain and
other hydrometeors, this effect is not accompanied by attenuation.
It causes a reduction in the value of XPD given by (5.74)
When all sources of depolarisation are included and assuming
equally powered carriers on both polarisations, the carrier-to-cross
polarisation interference power ratio for a given link (uplink or
downlink) can be calculated as:

of a carrier adjacent to a given carrier being captured by a satellite
transponder or an earth station receiver tuned to the frequency of the
carrier considered. Figure 5.30 illustrates the situation where ACI

affects a downlink carrier. Part of the spectrum of the adjacent carrier
at frequency fD2 falls into the earth station receiver tuned to the
carrier at frequency fD1 . The corresponding carrier-to-interference
power ratio is determined by the area labelled C with respect to
the area labelled ACI. Typical values of C/ACI for VSAT networks
are in the range 25 to 30 dB. Adjacent channel interference can be
reduced by adopting larger guard bands between carriers, at the
expense of a larger utilised bandwidth on the satellite transponder.

5.5.4

External interference

External interference originates outside the considered satellite system: transmissions by other satellites and stations, be it earth stations
or terrestrial ones (microwave relays on the earth). Figure 1.17
illustrates the geometry of external interference. Actually, VSAT networks operating at Ku-band can be operated in the exclusive bands
of Figure 1.15, and this protects those networks from microwave
relay interference.

5.5.4.1 Interference from adjacent satellite systems
The interference generated by an earth station into an adjacent
satellite, or by an adjacent satellite into an earth station, depends on
their respective antenna radiation patterns. Actual antenna patterns
should be considered but they may not be known at the early
planning stages of a VSAT network. Therefore, reference patterns
may be used instead. For VSATs and hub station antennas, one
can refer to the ITU-R Recommendation S672. Figure 5.31 displays
a typical VSAT antenna radiation pattern and a reference sidelobe
pattern. All reference patterns specify a sidelobe envelope level of
the form A − B log θ (dBi) where θ is the off-axis angle. In Figure 5.31,
A = 29 dBi for 2.5◦ ≤ θ < 7◦ and A = 32 dBi for 9.2◦ ≤ θ < 48◦ , and
B = 25.
In order to calculate the level of interference encountered at the
receiver end of a satellite link, it is necessary to know the angular
separation between two geostationary satellites as seen by an earth
station. Figure 5.32 displays the geometry where the satellites are
separated in longitude by an angle α. The angle θ represents the
angular separation between the two geostationary satellites as seen
by the earth station.
The distance d between the two satellites is given by:
d2 = R2w + R2a − 2Rw Ra cos θ

Rw and Ra are given by expression (2.8), and depend on the latitude

respect to the wanted and the adjacent satellite respectively. Note
that La − Lw = α. Table 5.11 provides some values of the θ/α ratio for
an orbital separation of 4◦ and different locations of the earth station.
It can be seen that for a practical situation where the earth station
is not too far away from the wanted satellite, the θ/α ratio remains
in the range 1.1 to 1.18. Therefore, a practical rule of thumb is:
θ = 1.15α

(5.81)

Uplink interference analysis
The uplink interference deals with the case where a satellite
transponder receives a wanted carrier from an earth station located
within the coverage of its receiving antenna and some carrier power
at the same frequency from an interfering station normally transmitting to an adjacent satellite, as illustrated in Figure 5.33. The worst
case is assumed, i.e. the wanted earth station is located at the edge
of coverage of the satellite it transmits to, and the interfering earth
station is located at the centre of coverage.

(5.88), (C/Ni )D = 15.7 dB.

5.5.4.2 Terrestrial interference
Bands allocated to satellite communications are most often also allocated to terrestrial microwave links. The only restricted frequency
bands are available at Ku-band and Ka-band for exclusive use for
satellite communications (see Figure 1.17). In those bands, VSAT
networks are protected against terrestrial interference. At C-band,
terrestrial interference is a major concern to VSAT networks. Indeed,
the smaller the earth station antenna and the lower the frequency,
the larger the beamwidth. Therefore small VSATs are sensitive to
interference, especially at C-band. For VSATs being used for business applications and installed at the user’s premises, possibly in
city centres, terrestrial interference at C-band may be important.
The most convenient way to protect the network from interference
is to use spread spectrum communications. The calculation of the
interference in a city environment is quite complex, and proceeding
to site measurements before installing VSATs and hub would be
recommended.

5.5.5

Conclusion

As a result of its small size, the VSAT antenna provides limited interference rejection. Terrestrial interference can be avoided by using
exclusive bands at 14/12 GHz and 30/20 GHz. Adjacent satellite
interference still remains. Should the adjacent satellites transmit
carriers with high EIRP on the frequency of the outbound link, then
the VSATs may receive an unacceptable level of interference.

226

RADIO FREQUENCY LINK ANALYSIS

The inbound links, as a result of the low EIRP of the transmitting VSATs, are received at the input of the satellite transponder
with low power. Should other stations transmit on the orthogonal
polarisation, the uplink part of the inbound link may suffer from
cross-polarisation interference, especially if those stations are not
properly aligned with the satellite antenna polarisation. The downlink part of the inbound link will also be contaminated by the cross
polarisation interference generated by the carriers conveyed by the
cross-polar transponder. It is therefore desirable, when planning a

transponder.
Rain or ice induced cross-polar interference may contribute in a
sensitive way to the overall level of interference a small percentage of
the time. This is to be considered when addressing link availability.

OVERALL LINK PERFORMANCE

The overall link is that from station to station. It comprises two
portions: the uplink from the transmitting station to the satellite,
and the downlink from the satellite to the receiving station. It is
considered here that uplinked carriers are ampliﬁed and frequency
converted by the satellite transponder before being transmitted on
the downlink (no on-board demodulation and remodulation).
The overall carrier power-to-noise power spectral density ratio at
the earth station receiver input (C/N0 )T measures the overall link
performance. Table 5.12 provides a summary of the main equations
to be used for evaluating (C/N0 )T . The meaning of each of the
notations is given in Table 5.13.

BIT ERROR RATE DETERMINATION

The overall radio frequency link performance is given by the value
of (C/N0 )T , which can be calculated from equation (5.7) introducing
the parameters discussed in the previous sections.
The discussion will now focus on ways to derive the quality of the
signal delivered to the user terminal, that is the bit error rate (BER).
The BER is a function of the dimensionless ratio Eb /N0 where Eb is
the energy per information bit and N0 the overall link noise power
spectral density, i.e. N0 = N0T as expressed by equation (5.5). The
energy per information bit is deﬁned as the energy accumulated
at the receiver from reception of carrier power CD during a time
interval equal to the time it takes to receive an information bit. At
information bit rate Rb , the time it takes to receive an information
bit is Tb = 1/Rb . Therefore:

(5.90)

(5.91)

The relationship between Eb /N0 and BER depends on the type of
modulation and forward error correction (FEC) scheme used. FEC
techniques are based on transmitting redundant bits along with the
information bits, in such a way as to allow the receiver to decode and
correct some of the erroneous bits. These techniques are presented
in [MAR02, p 169–182]. It must be made clear that, contrary to the
ARQ protocols presented in Chapter 4, section 4.5, FEC does not
guarantee error-free transmission. FEC only reduces the BER, given
(C/N0 )T , at the expense of a larger bandwidth.
Figure 5.35 displays a comparison between an uncoded link and
a coded one using BPSK or QPSK modulation. Curve 1 represents
the uncoded link performance and curves 2 the coded ones. It is
assumed here that both links deliver data to the user at the same rate
Rb and the same BER. The coding gain Gcod is deﬁned as the Eb /N0
saving introduced by the coding scheme at the considered BER, as
illustrated in Figure 5.35 for a BER of 10−6 and a code rate ρ = 7/8:

POWER VERSUS BANDWIDTH EXCHANGE

For a carrier conveying an information bit rate Rb , using forward
error correction (FEC) with code rate ρ, and modulation with
spectral efﬁciency Γ (ratio of bit rate to bandwidth), the required
bandwidth is:
Rb
(5.96)
B=
Γρ
Hence, a larger bandwidth is required for low values of code
rate, given the information bit rate Rb and the modulation scheme.
However, with low code rate one beneﬁts from a larger coding
gain and therefore a lower requirement on Eb /N0 which translates,
according to equation (5.95), into a reduced requirement for the
received carrier power. This suggests a potential power versus
bandwidth exchange, which will now be demonstrated through a
speciﬁc example.
Consider a VSAT transmitting at an information bit rate Rb =
64 kbs−1 . BPSK modulation is used with spectral efﬁciency Γ =
0.7 bs−1 Hz−1 . The required bit error rate BER = 10−7 . Table 5.14
gives the required values of Eb /N0 depending on the code rate,
as given by Figure 5.35, the corresponding values of (C/N0 )T ,
according to formulas (5.93) and (5.94), and bandwidth as given
by formula (5.96).
Figure 5.36 illustrates the power versus bandwidth exchange,
which is experienced by changing the code rate. This ﬂexible
exchange is paramount to any design of a VSAT network.

Figure 5.37 Architecture of the considered VSAT network

Uplink and downlink frequencies are all approximated respective to fU = 14.25 GHz and fD = 12.7 GHz. The service requirement
is a BER = 10−7 , which entails a required Eb /N0 = 11.3 dB without coding. The earth stations are assumed to be located so
that the minimum elevation angle for all stations is Emin = 35◦ .

RADIO FREQUENCY LINK ANALYSIS

233

For instance, the earth station can be at medium latitude (about
45◦ ) and within 20◦ of relative longitude with respect to the
satellite.
Table 5.15 displays the network parameters; Table 5.16 gives the
satellite, VSAT and hub characteristics; Table 5.17 indicates link
parameter calculations for clear sky and rain conditions (the selected
value of rain attenuation, ARAIN = 6 dB, is exceeded for 0.01%
of the time in Europe climatic region H, at an elevation angle
E = 35◦ ).
The network comprises G = 3 groups of L = 33 VSATs each, so
that the total number of VSATs in the network is 99. Each group is
being allocated a frequency band for its inbound links. The VSATs
of a group access this frequency band in a reservation/random
TDMA mode. Therefore, the inbound links are made of bursts
of inbound carriers. These bursts convey information bits at a
rate Rbinb = 64 kbs−1 . Coding with code rate ρinb = 1/2 is used,
with coding gain 5.5 dB at the required BER = 10−7 . Therefore, the
inbound transmitted bit rate within each burst is Rcinb = Rbinb /ρinb =
128 kbs−1 . The modulation is BPSK, with spectral efﬁciency Γ =
0.7 bs−1 .Hz−1 . Therefore, according to (5.96) the utilised bandwidth
per inbound link is Binb = 183 kHz.
The outbound link is a time division multiplex (TDM) at information bit rate Rboutb = 256 kbs−1 with code rate ρoutb = 1/2. The
transmitted bit rate is Rcoutb = 512 kbs−1 . The modulation is BPSK.

APPENDIX 1: TRAFFIC SOURCE MODELS
The purpose of trafﬁc source modelling is to provide mathematical
tools that can be used in simulations, and also give some insight
into the physical behaviour of the device acting as a source. For
any network design and performance evaluation, it is important to
have models. Such models should be matched to the actual trafﬁc,
measured at these interfaces.
The model should include the following features:
– the rate at which messages are generated;
– the time between messages, also named interarrival time;
– the duration (in seconds) or length (in bits) of the message.
The Poisson model is very popular and useful. The deﬁning
assumptions are as follows:
– the probability of one message being generated in a small time
interval ∆t(∆t → 0) is proportional to that interval, and therefore
equal to λ∆t, where λ is a constant;
– ∆t is considered small enough so that there cannot be more
than one arrival in ∆t, and the probability of no message being
generated in ∆t is equal to (1 − λ∆t).

Message generation
Based on these assumptions, it can be shown that the probability of
K messages being generated in an interval T, much larger than ∆t,
is given by:
(A1.1)
P(K) = (λT)K e−λT /K!
The average number of messages being generated in T seconds is
then:
K = λT
(A1.2)
So, the Poisson parameter introduced as a proportionality factor
for the small interval ∆t turns out to be the average number of
messages generated per unit time as well. Figure A1.1 represents
the probability P(K) of K messages being generated during time T
as a function of λT. It reaches a maximum equal to (K/e)K /K! for
λT = K.

Interarrival time (IAT)
It can also be shown that the time τ between messages is a continuously distributed exponential random variable:

Stop-and-wait (SW) protocol

to transmit W frames and stop until reception of the next ACK. If
a NACK is received, the number of frames that are retransmitted

APPENDIX 3: INTERFACE PROTOCOLS
This appendix intends to give brief information on most of the
common protocols. For more details, the reader is invited to refer to
the specialised literature, such as, for instance, [TUG-82][TAN-89]
and the relevant texts of the EIA (Electronic Industries Association)
and the ITU-T (formerly CCITT).

ASYNC (Asynchronous Communications)
Each information character or block of data is individually synchronised, usually by the use of start and stop elements. The gap

246

APPENDICES

between each character or block is not necessarily of a ﬁxed length.
Asynchronous data are usually produced by low speed terminals
with bit rates up to a few kbs−1 .

BISYNC (Binary Synchronous Communications),
also termed BSC
A set of control characters and control character sequences for
synchronised transmission of binary-coded data between devices in
a data communications system (see HDLC).

HDLC (High Data Level Protocol)
A Layer 2 (data link) protocol which rules orderly transfer of
information between interfaced computers or terminals. The basic
functions of HDLC are:
– to establish and terminate a connection between two terminals;
– to assure the message integrity through error detection, request
for retransmission, and positive or negative acknowledgements;
– to identify the sender and the receiver through polling or selection;
– to handle special control functions such as requests for status, station reset, reset acknowledgement, start, start acknowledgement,
and disconnection.

PAD (Packet Assembler–Disassembler)
Applies to exchange of serial data streams with character-mode
terminal and the packetising–depacketising of the corresponding
data exchanged with the ITU-T X25 terminal. Among the basic
functions of the PAD are:
– assembly of characters into packets destined for the X25 Data
Terminal Equipment (DTE);
– disassembly of the user data ﬁeld of packets destined for the
start–stop mode DTE (asynchronous transmission in which a
group of code elements corresponding to a character signal is
preceded by a start element and followed by a stop element);
– handling of virtual call set-up and clearing, resetting and interrupt procedures;

APPENDICES

247

– generation of service signals;
– a mechanism for forwarding packets when the proper conditions
exist, such as when a packet is full or an idle time expires;
– a mechanism for transmitting data characters, including start,
stop, and parity elements as appropriate to the start–stop DTE;
– a mechanism for handling a ‘break’ signal from the start–stop
DTE.

RS232
A layer 1 (physical layer) protocol standard as well as an electrical standard specifying handshaking functions between the Data
Terminal Equipment (DTE) and the Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE) over short distances (up to 15 m) at low speed data rates
(upper limit of 20 kbs−1 ).
RS232 makes use of a 25 pin connector. A positive voltage between
+5 and +25 V represents a logic 0, and a negative voltage between
−5 and −25 V represents logic 1.
The ITU-T counterparts of RS232 are V24 and V28.

RS422
A layer 1 (physical layer) protocol standard. It is a differential
balanced voltage interface standard capable of higher data rates
over longer distances than those speciﬁed in RS232.
The ITU-T counterparts of RS422 are Recommendations V11
and X27.

RS449
Expands speciﬁcations of RS232 to higher data rates and longer
distances (for instance, 2 Mbs−1 over 60 m cables). The mechanical,
functional and procedural interfaces are given in RS449, but the
electrical interfaces are given by RS423 for unbalanced transmission (all circuits share a common ground) and RS422 for balanced
transmission (each one of the circuits requires two wires with no
common ground). RS449 makes use of a 37 pin connector.

SDLC (Synchronous Data Link Control)
An IBM variant of HDLC.

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet
Protocol)

layers) developed to allow cooperating computers to share resources
across a network. Among the basic functions of TCP/IP are:
–
–
–
–

ﬁle transfer;
remote login;
computer mail;
access to distributed databases, etc.

V11 (also X27)
Deals with the electrical characteristics of balanced double-current
interchange circuits operating with data signalling rates up to
10 Mbs−1 . It is similar to RS422.

V24
A list of deﬁnitions for interchange circuits between Data Terminal
Equipment (DTE) and Data Circuit-terminating Equipment (DCE)
for transfer of binary data, control and timing signals. The
deﬁnitions are applicable to synchronous and asynchronous data
communications. It is similar to RS232.

V28
Deﬁnes the electrical characteristics for unbalanced double-current
interchange circuits operating below 20 kbs−1 . Binary 1 corresponds
to voltages lower than −3 V. Binary 0 corresponds to voltages higher
than +3 V. It is similar to RS232.

V35
Deﬁnes interchange circuits for data transmission at 48 kbs−1 . Practice has established V35 as a standard for interface circuits operating

APPENDICES

249

at 48, 56 and 64 kbs−1 using a 34 pin connector. It is similar to RS232,
with slight differences (no external transmit clock).

X3
Describes the basic functions and the user-selectable functions of
the packet assembler–disassembler (PAD). It applies to exchange of
serial data streams to/from a character-mode terminal from/to an
X25 terminal (transport layer).

X21
Applies to the DTE/DCE interface for synchronous operation on
public data networks. It deﬁnes functions at all three lower layers
of the network.

X25
Deﬁnes a set of protocols for block transfer between a host computer
and a packet switching network. For layer 1 (physical layer), X25
speciﬁes layer 1 of X21. For layer 2 (data link layer), a link access
protocol (LAP) is deﬁned using the principles of high level data link
control (HDLC). This layer provides the function of error and ﬂow
control for the access link between the DTE and the network. Each
frame has a check sequence to detect errors, and error frames are
retransmitted when requested by the receiving end or by time out.
Flow control is accomplished through the sending of receiver ready
and receiver not ready commands. Layer 3 of X25 (network layer)
deﬁnes the packet formats and control procedures for exchange
of information between a DTE and the network. X25 provides the
capability of multiplexing up to 4096 logical channels, or virtual
circuits, on a single access link. Each channel can be used for virtual
calls or a permanent virtual circuit. Each packet exchanged across
the interface has its associated logical channel number identiﬁed,
and each logical channel operates independently of the others. The
data packets are also identiﬁed by sequence numbers which are used
for ﬂow control within individual logical channels. The sequence
numbering may be based upon either modulo 8 for normal operation
or modulo 128 for extended transmission delay conditions. Data
packets are limited to a maximum data ﬁeld length (nominally 128
octets, with possible extension up to 1024 octets).

250

APPENDICES

X28
Deﬁnes the interface for the start–stop mode terminals accessing
the packet assembler–disassembler (PAD) on a public data network.
It speciﬁes procedures for establishing an access information path
between a start–stop DTE and a PAD, and for character interchange
and service initialisation between them, as well as for the exchange
of control information. It also summarises PAD commands and
service signals.

X29
Speciﬁes the procedures for the exchange of control information and user data between an X25 DTE and a packet assembler–disassembler (PAD).

APPENDIX 4: ANTENNA PARAMETERS
Gain
Definition
The gain of an antenna is the ratio of the power radiated (or received)
per unit solid angle by the antenna in a given direction to the power
radiated (or received) per unit solid angle by an isotropic antenna
fed with the same power.

Maximum gain
The gain is maximal in the direction of maximum radiation (the
electromagnetic axis of the antenna, also called the boresight) and
has a value given by:
 
4π
Aeff
(A4.1)
Gmax =
λ2
where λ = c/f . c is the velocity of light (c = 3 × 108 ms−1 ) and f is the
frequency of the electromagnetic wave. Aeff is the effective aperture
area of the antenna. For an antenna with a circular aperture or
reﬂector of diameter D and geometric surface A = π D2 /4, Aeff = ηa A,
where ηa is the efﬁciency of the antenna (a typical value for antenna

Antenna radiation pattern
The antenna radiation pattern indicates the variations of gain with
direction. For an antenna with a circular aperture or reﬂector,
this pattern has rotational symmetry about its boresight and can
be represented by its variation within any plane containing the
boresight. Figure A4.1 displays a typical pattern which can be represented either in polar coordinates (Figure A4.1(a)) or in Cartesian
coordinates (Figure A4.1(b)).
Figure A4.1 reveals the major lobe which contains the direction
of maximum gain Gmax at boresight (θ = 0◦ ), and the sidelobes with
smaller secondary maxima.

Half power beamwidth
It is convenient to characterise the width of the antenna radiation
pattern by the angle between the directions in which the gain falls
to half its maximum value. This angle is called the 3 dB beamwidth
θ3dB . A practical formula for θ3dB is:

It can be noted that θ3dB increases with decreasing D, which
indicates that a small aperture antenna displays a large beamwidth.

Polarisation
The wave radiated by an antenna consists of an electric ﬁeld component and a magnetic ﬁeld component. These two components are
orthogonal and perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the
wave. They vary in time at the frequency of the wave. By convention
the polarisation of the wave is deﬁned by the direction of the electric
ﬁeld. In general, the direction of the electric ﬁeld is not ﬁxed and its
amplitude is not constant. During one period, the projection of the
extremity of the vector representing the electric ﬁeld onto a plane
perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave describes
an ellipse, as illustrated in Figure A4.2. The polarisation is said to
be elliptical.
Two waves are in orthogonal polarisation if their electrical ﬁelds
describe identical ellipses in opposite directions. In particular, the

– two orthogonal circular polarisations are described as right-hand
circular and left-hand circular (the direction of rotation is for an
observer looking in the direction of propagation);
– two orthogonal linear polarisations are described as horizontal
and vertical (relative to a local reference).
An antenna designed to transmit or receive a wave of given polarisation cannot transmit or receive in the orthogonal polarisation. This
allows two simultaneous links to be set up at the same frequency
between the same two locations, so called ‘frequency reuse’ by
orthogonal polarisation. To achieve this, either two polarised antennas are installed at each end or, preferably, one antenna designed
for operation with the two speciﬁed polarisations may be used. This
practice must, however, take account of imperfections in the antennas and the possible depolarisation of the waves by the transmission
medium (the atmosphere, especially with rain, in the case of satellite
links). These effects introduce mutual interference of the two links.
This situation is illustrated in Figure A4.3 which relates to the case
of two orthogonal linear polarisations (the illustration is also valid
for any two orthogonal polarisations).
Let a and b be the amplitudes, assumed to be equal, of the
electric ﬁelds of the two waves transmitted simultaneously with
linear polarisation, ac and bc the amplitudes received with the same
polarisation, and ax and bx the amplitudes received with orthogonal
polarisations. The following concepts are deﬁned:

In practice, XPI and XPD are comparable and are often confused
within the term isolation.
The values and relative values of the components vary as a function of the direction relative to the antenna boresight. The antenna
is thus characterised, for a given polarisation, by a radiation pattern for the nominal polarisation (co-polar) and a radiation pattern
for the orthogonal polarisation (cross-polar). Cross polarisation discrimination is usually maximal on the antenna axis and degrades
for directions other than boresight.

APPENDIX 5: EMITTED AND RECEIVED POWER
Effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP)
of a transmitter
The power radiated per unit solid angle by an isotropic antenna
fed from a radio frequency source of power PT is given by PT /4π
(Wsteradian−1 ).
In a direction where the value of transmission gain is GT , any
antenna radiates a power per unit solid angle equal to GT (PT /4π ) =
(PT GT )/4π (Wsteradian−1 ).
The product PT GT is called the effective isotropic radiated power
(EIRP). It is expressed in W.
EIRP = PT GT

(W)

EIRP(dBW) = PT (dBW) + GT (dBi)

ratio of the transmitted to the received power in a link between two
isotropic antennas.

APPENDIX 6: CARRIER AMPLIFICATION
Carrier ampliﬁcation takes place at the transmitting earth station (a
VSAT or the hub) and on-board the satellite, within each transponder. Power ampliﬁers used are either solid state power ampliﬁers
(SSPAs) or traveling wave tubes (TWTs). Both types act as non-linear
devices when operated near saturation, where the output power is
maximal. The non-linearity has two aspects: a decreasing power
gain, as the output power comes to saturation, and a variation in the
phase of the ampliﬁed carrier relative to the input phase.
Figure A6.1 displays typical transfer characteristics for a power
ampliﬁer. All quantities are normalised to their respective values at
saturation, when the ampliﬁer is operated in a single carrier mode.
Denoting by P1o the output power, and by P1i the input power (1
stands for single carrier drive, o for output, i for input), and (P1o )sat
and (P1i )sat those quantities at saturation, one deﬁnes the output
back-off (OBO) and the input back-off (IBO) as:
P1o
(P1o )sat


P1o
or OBO (dB) = 10 log
(P1o )sat
OBO =

P1i
(P1i )sat


P1i
or IBO (dB) = 10 log
(P1i )sat
IBO =

(A6.1)

(A6.2)

The values available from the TWT manufacturer are the output
power at saturation (P1o )sat and the power gain at saturation Gsat .
From these two quantities, one can derive (P1i )sat as:
(P1i )sat =

(P1o )sat
Gsat

(A6.3)

For example, a 50 W TWT, with a 55 dB gain, displays an input
power at saturation (P1i )sat = 50 W/105.5 = 158 µW.
With the above deﬁnitions, the values for OBO (dB) and IBO (dB)
are negative in the normal range of operation, i.e. below saturation.

Figure A6.1 Power amplifier characteristics: single carrier operation

Note that some people deﬁne OBO and IBO as the inverses of
expressions (5.53) and (5.54). OBO (dB) and IBO (dB) values are
then positive.
The aspect of the curves in Figure A6.1 is non-linear. When
operated in a multicarrier mode, the non-linearity generates intermodulation and the TWT output power is shared, not only between
the ampliﬁed carriers, but also with the intermodulation products
(see section 5.1.3). Denoting by Pno and Pni , respectively, the output
and input power of one carrier among the n ampliﬁed ones, one can
deﬁne:
– the output back-off per carrier:
OBO1 = single carrier output power/single carrier output
power at saturation
