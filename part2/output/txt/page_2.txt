Overview
Eutelsat OneWeb
Eutelsat OneWeb
is part of the Eutelsat Group. They are the world’s first integrated GEO-LEO integrated satellite communications operator, transforming space communications.
Eutelsat OneWeb's LEO network is designed for maritime, enterprise, mobility and government customers. Each satellite can connect seamlessly to the Intellian user terminals and ground network below, transmitting data in real-time and at high speed as they fly. LEO antennas can view multiple moving satellites at any time and connect with the greatest accuracy, even in places that are hardest to reach.
Customer satisfaction is evident through its Service Level Agreement (SLA) model, which offers customers a choice of flexible options underpinned by service levels, defined by straightforward CIR (Committed Information Rate) and MIR (Maximum Information Rate) packages.
