Intellian v240MT
The Intellian v240MT systems are more than just antennas. The complete satellite communication infrastructure not only delivers a safe and reliable high-speed connection up to 3Gbps, but also provides system redundancy of the satellite networks and frequency bands used, along with complete below-decks redundancy of antenna controllers and modems in a Dual Data Center configuration.

The Intelligent Mediator
The system is capable of switching multiple antennas. Two antennas may be tracking moving MEO satellites while a third could be pointed at a fixed GEO satellite. If one antenna becomes blocked by a part of the ship, the system will automatically select the next best solution and switch without any loss of connection for those on-board. All this happens automatically, without any intervention.
