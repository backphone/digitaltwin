
You may need to modify the Java security setting, in order to download the log file.

Please refer to attached screenshot:
1. Go to control panel on the PC, and open Java; 2. Under Security tab, set security the lowest level. 

Depending on the java version,  your Java may show different configuration from the sent screenshot. That is fine. Just need to set it to the minimum level.
