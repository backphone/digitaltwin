INSTALLING THE ANTENNA

Planning the Installation
Selection of Antenna Installation Site
Install the antenna in accordance with the following procedures to insure maximum
performance of the antenna.
The ideal antenna site has a clear view of the horizon or satellite all around. Please
be sure there are no obstacles within 15º above the center of the antenna. Any
obstacles can prevent the antenna from transmitting and receiving the satellite
signal.
Do not install the antenna near the radar especially on the same plane, as its energy
levels may overload the antenna front-end circuits. It is recommended to position
the antenna at least 4 feet (1.2 m) above or below the level of the radar and minimum
of 15 feet (4.6 m) away from the high power short wave radars.
The mounting platform should be rigid enough and not subjected to excessive
vibration. The movement of the antenna can be minimized by installing at the
center of the vessel. If these conditions can be only partially satisfied, find the best
compromised installation site between the various considerations.

GX100 – Marine Satellite Communication System

Setting block zones
The blockages around an antenna may interfere with the reception of the satellite
signal. Therefore, It is required to set a block zone which notifies users that antenna
cannot receive satellite signal due to blockages. You can create five block zones
by inputting azimuth and elevation value with ACU. When the antenna is within the
block zones, the ACU works as follows.
1. “BLOCK” will be displayed on the ACU screen.
2. Tracking continues as long as the signal level is greater than the predefined
threshold value. When the signal level drops below the threshold value the
antenna will wait and then re-target the satellite you targeted last. The amount
of time the antenna waits before entering search mode is called the "Search
Wait Time" and can be adjusted in the parameters settings. The antenna will
continue to re-target the satellite until the satellite is re-acquired and tracking
can be resumed.
3. A transmit inhibit output from the ACU will disable/mute the modem transmission.
RF Hazard Precautions
The antenna is designed to be used with radiation transmit equipment manufactured
by others. Exposure to RF radiation, including exposure associated with an improper
use of the transmit equipment, may be hazardous to persons close to the above
deck unit. Ensure safety of personnel who work on the system.
During transmission, ensure to keep the minimum safety distance. The recommended
minimum safety distance to the reflector on the focal line is about 25m, based on a
radiation level of 5mW/ cm2 that applies under occupational/controlled environment.
No hazard exists >20° below the antenna’s mounting plane.

Safe access from radiation hazard
22

INSTALLING THE ANTENNA

System Cables
Before installing the system cables, you need to take the following points into
consideration.
1. All cables need to be well clamped and protected from physical damage
and exposure to heat and humidity.
2. Cable with an acute bend is not allowed.
3. Where a cable passes through an exposed bulkhead or deck head,
a watertight gland or swan neck tube should be used.
• RF Cable (Customer Furnished)

Due to the voltage losses across the length of the RF coax on L-Band, Intellian
recommends the following 50 ohm coax cable types for standard system
installations. For cables that run longer than 200 meters, please consult Intellian
Technologies.

Mounting the ACU
Intellian supplies two types of mounting methods (a) 19” Rack Mount Type and (b)
Table Mount Type to mount the ACU.

19" Rack mount type

19” Rack Mount Type
- The ACU should be installed using the two supplied Rack Mounting Brackets
which allow for a side 19” rack mounting configuration.
- Using the Flat Head screws supplied, attach the mounting brackets to the sides
of the ACU.
- Place the ACU in the location where it is going to be installed.
- Connect the cables to the rear of the ACU.

Table mount type

Table Mount Type
- The ACU should be installed using the two supplied Table Mounting Brackets
which allow for a top or bottom mounting configuration.
- Using the Sems Bolts supplied, attach the mounting brackets to the sides of the
ACU.
- Place the ACU in the location where it is going to be installed.
- Using a pencil to mark the 4 hole positions (2 each side), and use the appropriate
drill bit to screw down the brackets.
- Connect the cables to the rear of the ACU.
WARNING: Ensure that the cables connected to the ACU are long enough to prevent
damage when the ACU is pulled out from the rack.

GX100 – Marine Satellite Communication System

Gyrocompass Connection
Connecting the System with a Gyrocompass
The ship’s gyrocompass provides true heading input to the antenna which easily
allows the antenna to target and acquire the desired satellite. Intellian always
recommends to connect a gyrocompass to the antenna through the gyrocompass
interface on the ACU. If the ship’s gyrocompass output is other than NMEA 0183
and NMEA 2000, a separate purchase of an NMEA converter is required.

Recommended Cable
• NMEA 0183 / NMEA 2000 Gyrocompass Cable (Customer supplied)
• Connector Type: 2 conductors for NMEA 0183, 5 conductors for NMEA 2000
• NMEA heading sentence: xx HDT (4800 Baud, 8, N,1)
If there is no HDT sentence, then use HDM sentence instead.
• NMEA 2000 heading PGN Number = 127250 (Vessel Heading)

38

INSTALLING THE ACU

Connecting the System without a Gyrocompass
For a vessel where the ship’s gyrocompass is not installed or is difficult to be
connected, the Intellian Gyro-Free satellite search function will be automatically
enabled to allow the antenna to lock onto the desired satellite without requiring an
external heading input.
The table below provides an example of the Gyro-Free satellite search algorithm.
The Search 1 or Search 3 satellite search pattern will be triggered according to the
existence of heading input and the setting of the heading device.
Search 1: The antenna will search for the target satellite by turning its azimuth
angle in CCW(Counter Clockwise) direction until the antenna receives
the lock signal from the modem or the DVB(Digital Video Broadcasting)
transponder of the target satellite is decoded by the antenna.
Search 3: The antenna will search for the target satellite by turning its azimuth angle
directly to the position calculated using the ship’s heading input and lock
onto the satellite.

Search 1: A search pattern 1 will automatically be initiated when the ship’s heading
input does not exist or has failed. The antenna will go to the relative azimuth position
0º at the calculated elevation and search in the azimuth CCW direction and search
up +0.5º & down -0.5º with a total 6º(±3º) in elevation. The search cycle will repeat
until the antenna receives the lock signal from the modem or the DVB transponder
of the target satellite is decoded by the antenna. If the desired signal is found and
above the predefined detect level, the ACU will enter to Search 3. However, the
antenna will not initiate Search 3 pattern but go into TRACKING mode immediately
if the desired signal is above the predefined tracking threshold level. If the detected

Establish a data
communication

Access ACU through Serial Communication
1.
Connect a 9 pin serial cable between the PC INTERFACE connector on
the ACU and the 9 pin serial port on the PC. (Or you can use a USB cable
to setup serial connection between a PC and the USB port on the ACU.)
2.
Select serial at communication type combo-box.
3.
The baud rate of the ACU is 57600.
4.
Select a COM port which is not occupied by other devices.
5.
Click the Connect button.
Access ACU through Network Communication (TCP/IP)
1.
Turn off the wireless connection while using this method.
2.
Connect your PC to the Management Port. (See 'PC to ACU Communication
Setup' section for other network connection methods.)
3.
Select Network at communication type combo-box.
4.
Enter in the ACU’s IP address (Factory default : 192.168.1.2)
5.
Enter in the ACU’s port number (Factory default : 4002)
6.
Click the Connect button then the Authentication window will appear.
7.
Login by using the username and password below:
Username: intellian (Factory default)
Password: 12345678 (Factory default)

NOTE: If the remote access PC is located in the same network group with the ACU,
the ACU can be accessed through the internal IP address. But, if the remote access
PC is located outside of the network group, the ACU’s IP address should be changed
to the IP address assigned by the network service provider.

WARNING:
- Do not plug a USB to the ACU while TCP/IP communication is in use.
Doing so will disable current PC Software Control because the USB
connection has higher priority than TCP/IP connection.
- The amount of data will increase rapidly if Network Communication is in use.
Intellian recommends using Aptus Web.

GX100 – Marine Satellite Communication System

2. Antenna – Advanced Info.
This view provides information on the Tilt Sensor Bias, Conical Range, EL Adjust,
Rate Sensor, Search Parameter and Block Zone.

-Tilt Sensor Bias: This maintains the elevation and the cross level axes
in order to keep the pedestal parallel to the horizon. Adjust the two
solid-state tilt sensors to provide absolute cross-level tilt of the antenna and
elevation feedback to eliminate long-term pointing drift (error). Tilt bias must be
adjusted when the antenna control board or sensor box is replaced.
If the bubble on the button level located on the sensor box is
not centered, follow the steps below to adjust the tilt sensor bias.
· Step 1. Enter Setup mode and press the “Ready” button to bring
the elevation and cross-level to 0.
· Step 2. Select “EL” from the drop down list and press Up and
Down arrow keys to adjust the bubble until it is located in the
center ring of the button level.

Down arrow keys to adjust the bubble until it is located in the
center ring of the button level.
96

Aptus®

· Step 4. Press the “Restart” icon to restart the antenna.
- Rate Sensor: is used to calibrate the DC voltage output from the three rate sensors (azimuth, elevation, and cross-level). These are used to sense antenna motion
that corresponds to the ship’s motion (roll, pitch, and yaw) for stabilizing the pedestal. The DC voltage output from each of the rate sensors may vary by an amount
which is directly proportional to the direction and rate of motion induced on it.
Before calibrating the rate sensors located in the Sensor box, make sure that the
antenna is placed on a rigid and flat platform. During the calibration process, any
motion of the antenna should be avoided as it can affect the antenna’s performance. Proceed with the following steps to perform the calibration.
· Step 1. Enter Setup mode
· Step 2. Press the “Idle Mode” button to release the elevation and
cross level motor brakes while the antenna is in Setup mode.
· Step 3. Check whether or not the bubble is located at the center
of the button level. If not, move it to the center by following the
previous instruction of Tilt Sensor Bias adjustment.
· Step 4. Press the “Bias Check” button to calibrate the rate sensor.
A blue circle will be displayed next to the Bias Check button if the
calibration is completed. A red circle will be displayed if calibration
failed. A green circle will be displayed during the calibration
process.
- Conical Range: The relative force of the motors controlling azimuth and elevation. Set the conical range while the antenna is in tracking mode.
- EL Adjust: The elevation adjustment is to offset the angle difference between the
mechanical elevation angle and actual elevation angle. If this value is not properly
adjusted, the antenna may take longer time for satellite search or tracking.
- Search Parameter:
· Wait time: set the time-out for automatic initiation of a search after
the signal level drops below the pre-defined threshold value.
97

GX100 – Marine Satellite Communication System

· Search Step: set increment step size.
